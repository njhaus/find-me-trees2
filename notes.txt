Problems:
1. pages/browse/iconData : NEED TO REFACTOR THIS-- CODE SMELLS WHEN HARDCODING THE COLOR IN TWO PLACES< BUT I AM HAVING TROUBLE ACCESSING THE COLOR FROM WITHIN THE OBJECT

2. useAuth / authContext : temporary accesstoken does not expire on client side. It feels pointless. (refresh token DOES expire, so that's good and is the more important of the two)


Possible things to do:
1. Filter Form (pages/browse/SearchFilters) Needs to be validated?

2. I hate the _id name in the User model for the tree id. It causes stupid object nesting issues such as 'item._id._id'. I want to change it, but it leads to so many other changes that just don't work.
EXAMPLE: (in UserOption)
// ._id._id is the tree id stored in the user, then the actual id of the tree in the populated tree data. I want to change this, but when I tried it broke everything, so I will need to come back to it.
  useEffect(() => {
    const userKeyData = userData[userDataKey];
    console.log("USER KEY DATA");
    console.log(userKeyData);
    if (Array.isArray(userKeyData)) {
      console.log("IS IT TRUE?");
      console.log(userKeyData.some((item) => item._id._id === id));
      setBtnSlide(userKeyData.some((item) => item._id._id === id));
    } else {
      setBtnSlide(false);
    }
  }, [userData]);
