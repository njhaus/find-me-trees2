Problems:
1. pages/browse/iconData : NEED TO REFACTOR THIS-- CODE SMELLS WHEN HARDCODING THE COLOR IN TWO PLACES< BUT I AM HAVING TROUBLE ACCESSING THE COLOR FROM WITHIN THE OBJECT

2. useAuth / authContext : temporary accesstoken does not expire on client side. It feels pointless. (refresh token DOES expire, so that's good and is the more important of the two)

Possible things to do:
1. Filter Form (pages/browse/SearchFilters) Needs to be validated?
