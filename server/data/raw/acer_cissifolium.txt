INTRODUCTION
Quickly growing to 30 feet tall and wide, Wright
Acacia forms a rounded, open canopy composed of
small, bright green leaflets and remains semi-evergreen
in the lower South (Fig. 1). The showy springtime
displays of 1.5-inch-long spikes of yellow blossoms
are abundantly produced over the slightly drooping
branches. The blooms are followed by two to fourinch-long, brown, compressed pods which contain
small seeds.

susceptible
Pest resistance: no pests are normally seen on the
tree
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Multiple trunks arise from the ground growing into
the rounded canopy which provides moderately dense
shade. The tree is well suited for planting near a patio
or deck, or it can make a nice street tree or parking lot
tree for hot, dry sites. Little irrigation is required after
the tree is well established in the landscape. The
spreading crown can cover an area rather quickly,
producing ample shade in a small landscape. Plant
trees on 20 foot centers to form an arcade of finetextured small trees.
Wright Acacia should be grown in full sun on
well-drained soil. Acacias often develop a thin canopy
if grown in partial sun. The somewhat-drooping
branches may require regular pruning if planted close
to sidewalks or streets to allow passage of vehicles and
pedestrians.
Propagation is by seed, which germinate easily, or
by collection of small plants.
Pests
No pests are of major concern.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern.
