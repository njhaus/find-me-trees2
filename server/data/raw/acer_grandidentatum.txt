INTRODUCTION
This North American native reaches 50 feet in
height with a broad, spreading canopy and grayishbrown bark which may be either smooth or scaly (Fig.
1). The 2 to 5-inch-diameter, lustrous, dark green,
lobed leaves which have a pale underside are noted for
their striking brilliance in fall, when they change into
beautiful shades of red, orange, and yellow before
dropping. The insignificant, hairy, yellow flowers
appear among the leaves in late spring and are
followed by the production of one-inch-long, winged
seeds.

Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: tree has outstanding ornamental
features and could be planted more
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Ozone sensitivity: tolerant
Verticillium wilt susceptibility: susceptible
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
This Maple may need some training to develop a
dominant central leader. Once selected, this leader
should more or less stay dominant. This can make
Bigtooth Maple a good candidate for planting along
streets in an area with plenty of soil space for root
expansion.
Bigtooth Maple will grow in full sun or partial
shade and is found most often in its natural habitat in
moist, well-drained soils. It tolerates limestone soils
well. Plants in the wild grown in open areas have
withstood long periods of drought.
Pests
No pests are of major concern.
