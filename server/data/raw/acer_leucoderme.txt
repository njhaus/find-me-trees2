INTRODUCTION
This 25 to 30-foot-tall native North American tree
is reportedly quite similar to Acer barbatum or Florida
Maple and is often seen with multiple trunks (Fig. 1).
The chalky white or light gray bark is quite attractive,
with the bark on older trees becoming ridged and
blackened near the ground. The two to three-inchdiameter, lobed leaves, with fuzzy undersides, give a
spectacular display in the fall months, ranging from
shimmering yellow to vivid orange and deep red.

Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: tree has winter interest due to
unusual form, nice persistent fruits, showy winter
trunk, or winter flowers
Outstanding tree: not particularly outstanding
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Verticillium wilt susceptibility: susceptible
Pest resistance: no pests are normally seen on the
tree
USE AND MANAGEMENT
The striking white bark makes this Maple well
suited for planting as a specimen displayed against a
dark background. A row of these Maples planted
along a dark glass building wall or other dark structure
would get peopleâ€™s attention. Surprisingly underused,
this small Maple is well suited for a variety of sites,
including residences.
Chalk Maple grows well in full sun, partial shade,
or deep shade, and has a high tolerance for dry soils.
The tree is quite popular in the midwest in areas with
alkaline soil pH.
