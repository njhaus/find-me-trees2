Ohio Buckeye1
Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2
INTRODUCTION
A true North American native, Ohio Buckeye
forms a short trunk with a low branching structure,
creating an oval to rounded canopy 40 to 50 feet wide
on a tree 50 to 70 feet tall (Fig. 1). The four to sixinch-long, coarse, bright green, palmately compound
leaves have an unpleasant odor when crushed, as do
the twigs, giving this tree its other common name of
Fetid Buckeye. The fragrance should be a warning
sign for this plant since all parts of it are poisonous, a
factor which should be considered when placing it in
the landscape. One of the first trees to shed its leaves
in autumn, Ohio Buckeye puts on a vivid display of
bright orange and yellow fall foliage. The spring
flowers are also quite showy, the erect, yellow/green,
six-inch-high panicles decorating the branches. The
one to two-inch-long, showy, brown fruits ripen in late
summer and may become a litter problem since they
are very prickly. These fruits are quite popular with
squirrels and other wildlife.

Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: tree has winter interest due to
unusual form, nice persistent fruits, showy winter
trunk, or winter flowers
Outstanding tree: not particularly outstanding
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Ozone sensitivity: sensitive or moderately tolerant
Verticillium wilt susceptibility: not known to be
susceptible
Pest resistance: very sensitive to one or more pests
or diseases which can affect tree health or aesthetics
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Ohio Buckeye will grow in full sun or partial
shade on well-drained, fertile soil but should not be
exposed to extended drought or excessive heat, two
factors which make this tree unsuitable for use as a
street tree. Falling fruit would also be a problem
along streets. It is suited for naturalized plantings or
for establishing a native grove in a park. The fruit can
be quite entertaining for children.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests
No pests are of major concern.
Diseases
Leaf blotch, powdery mildew, and leaf scorch.
