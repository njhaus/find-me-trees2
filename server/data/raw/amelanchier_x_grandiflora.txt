INTRODUCTION
Apple Serviceberry is a hybrid between
Amelanchier canadensis and Amelanchier laevis that
grows 15 to 25 feet tall (Fig. 1). Multiple stems are
upright and highly branched forming a dense shrub, or
if properly pruned in the nursery, a small tree. It is
superior to either species in that it suckers less and is
adapted to a wide range of soils, and tolerates some
drought. The main ornamental feature is the white
flowers that are larger than those of other
amelanchiers. The flowers are borne in early spring
and are at first tinged with pink but later fade to white.
The young leaves are purplish and the fall color is
yellow to orange. Edible fruit attracts birds. Welladapted for planting beneath power lines due to its
small size.

Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: tree has outstanding ornamental
features and could be planted more
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Ozone sensitivity: tolerant
Pest resistance: very sensitive to one or more pests
or diseases which can affect tree health or aesthetics
USE AND MANAGEMENT
‘Cumulus’ - is moderately columnar, may sucker
at the root collar; ‘Robin Hill’ has an upright habit, 20
to 25 feet tall, sensitive to drought; ‘Autumn
Brilliance’ is supposedly resistant to leaf spot.
Pests
Cambium miners cause concern when noticed but
are not very damaging to the tree. The mines can
extend from a twig all the way down to the roots. The
mines are light colored lines in the bark. No controls
are suggested.
A leaf miner will mine leaves, particularly the
lower half of the leaf. The mines are irregular in
shape.
The leaves of amelanchier are skeletonized by at
least two insects. The first insect forms small cocoons
on the undersides of leaves. Skeletonized leaves look
as though they have windows in them after the insects
scrape tissue off the top and bottom of the leaves.
The second insect is the larva of the pear sawfly. The
larvae are black to greenish black and look slimy.
Adult sawflies lay eggs in May and June and again in
August. Heavily skeletonized leaves drop off.
Several borers attack amelanchier. Healthy trees
are considered less susceptible so regular fertilization
and watering during dry spells will help prevent borer
attacks.
Spider mites will feed on amelanchier. These
insects are hard to detect as they are so small. The
main symptom of mite injury is the loss of green leaf
coloration. If the infestation is heavy, very fine
webbing may be seen. Horticultural oil sprays help
control mite infestations.
Aphids of several types suck juices from
amelanchier. Heavy infestations cause distortion of
the foliage and new growth, and deposit large amounts
of sticky honeydew on lower foliage. Black sooty
mold will grow on the honeydew.
Diseases
Witches broom, also called black mildew, infects
the growing point causing the formation of many
stems. The cluster of stems is called the witches
broom. Another symptom is a black fungal growth,
coating the undersides of the leaves. The damage to
Amelanchier x grandiflora -- Apple Serviceberry Page 4
the tree is usually not serious and the brooms can be
pruned off. No chemical controls are suggested.
Leaf blight can cause leaf drop when a severe
infection occurs. The disease causes small purple
spots on the leaves. The spots enlarge and turn brown,
later a small black dot will be seen in the center of the
spot. Large numbers of spots cause infected leaves to
drop.
Fire blight is characterized by the sudden wilting
and death of branch tips. The blossoms wilt, blacken
and hang on the twig. The bark is shriveled and has
small bumps or blisters on it. Sometimes gum oozes
out of the infected area and a crack forms between the
diseased and healthy bark. Control with chemicals is
difficult. Diseased branches should be pruned out.
Make the cut at least four inches beyond the diseased
area. Disinfect pruning tools with bleach between
cuts. Fertilizing heavily with nitrogen increases
susceptibility to fire blight.
Powdery mildews of several types cause white
powdery growth on the leaves of amelanchier. Late in
the season no controls may be needed.
Fruit rot be a problem in wet weather. The fruits
are often eaten by birds so may not be around long
enough to become diseased.
Cedar rusts can be troublesome.
