INTRODUCTION
This upright, densely-foliated, evergreen small tree
can reach a height of 30 feet with a variable spread
(Fig. 1). The large, seven-inch-long, dark green,
glossy leaves makes it ideal for a small-scale shade or
specimen tree, or it can be allowed to grow into a tall
screen. Throughout the year, two-inch-long, purplishwhite, non-showy tubular flowers are produced on
short stalks. These blooms are followed by smooth,
shiny green, four-inch-long fruits which have a thin,
hard shell and contain numerous 1/2-inch-long, edible
black seeds in white pulp. The furrowed tree bark is
grey and rough.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Growing in full sun or partial shade on a wide
range of soils, Black Calabash has only marginal salttolerance and is very susceptible to wind damage.
Top-heavy trees are known to blow over in high
winds. Be sure to untangle circling or kinked roots
before planting to help prevent this from occurring.
Proper branch thinning can also help prevent this from
occurring.
Propagation is by seed, cuttings, or air-layerings.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases are of major concern.
