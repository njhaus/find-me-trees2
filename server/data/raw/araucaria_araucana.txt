INTRODUCTION
Monkey-Puzzletree is a large, bizarre evergreen,
60 to 70 feet tall and 30 to 35 feet wide, which forms
a loose, see-through, pyramidal shape with a straight
trunk (Fig. 1). The tree is so open in habit you could
almost look at it and not see it. The leaves are dark
green, stiff, with sharp needles densely arranged on
horizontal, irregular, upwardly-sweeping branches.
Monkey-Puzzletree makes an attractive, novelty
specimen for a large, open yard or commercial
landscape. It is normally planted only as an oddity
someplace in the rear of a landscape out of view from
most passers-by but could be the specimen feature in a
large oriental landscape.
