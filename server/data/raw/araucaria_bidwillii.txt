INTRODUCTION
This large evergreen has a single upright trunk,
tiered branching habit, and a pyramidal or columnar
shape (Fig. 1). Eventually reaching a height of about
80 feet, False Monkey Puzzle possesses a moderate
growth rate. The tree would grow taller, but lightning
frequently limits height growth in the eastern U.S.
The dark green, two-inch-long, individual leaves are
lanceolate when young becoming 1/2-inch ovals at
maturity. Both leaf types appear on the tree at the
same time. The large, spiny, 10 to 15-pound cones are
rare in cultivation.

with mowing
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: not particularly outstanding
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Although they provide some shade, they are not
suitable for patios or terraces because they are too
large and large surface roots are common. In
addition, the columnar-formed trees generally cast
limited shade due to the narrow crown. Many people
forget how tall these trees grow. They often have an
attractive pyramidal form (like a fir or spruce tree)
when they are small, but they quickly grow too tall for
most residential sites. This tree is best saved for
large-scale landscapes like parks and municipal
buildings.
Growing best in full sun locations, this tree thrives
on a variety of soils and is moderately salt tolerant.
Young plants should be watered well, especially
during periods of drought. Be sure to prune out
multiple trunks or leaders as they should be grown
with one central leader.
Propagation is by seeds or cuttings of erect shoot
tips only.
Pests
Scale and sooty mold are minor problems.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern. Leaf spots are a
minor problem.
