INTRODUCTION
This large evergreen has a single upright trunk,
tiered branching habit, and a narrow pyramidal or
columnar shape (Fig. 1). Eventually reaching a height
of about 80 feet, the tree possesses a rapid growth rate.
The tree would grow taller, but lightning frequently
limits height growth in the eastern U.S. The dark
green, 1/2-inch-long, individual leaves on young trees
are lanceolate and look somewhat like spruce or fir
needles at first glance. Mature leaves are somewhat
contorted on twisted branches. Both leaf types appear
on the tree at the same time. The trunk is often
curved and swollen at the base and black. The large,
spiny, 10 to 15-pound cones are rare in cultivation.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Although they provide some shade, they are not
suitable for patios or terraces because they are too
large and large surface roots are common. In addition,
columnar-formed trees generally cast limited shade due
to the narrow crown. Many people forget how tall
these trees grow. They often have an attractive
pyramidal form (like a fir or spruce tree) when they
are small, but they quickly grow too tall for most
residential sites. They can live as a house plant for a
long time if not overwatered.
Growing best in full sun locations, this tree thrives
on a variety of soils and is moderately salt tolerant.
Young plants should be watered well, especially
during periods of drought. Be sure to prune out
multiple trunks or leaders as they should be grown
with one central leader.
Propagation is by seeds or cuttings of erect shoot
tips only.

Diseases
No diseases are of major concern. Sooty mold,
and leaf spot are minor problems.
