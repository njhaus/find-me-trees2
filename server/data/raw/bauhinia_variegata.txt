BAUHINIA VARIEGATA: ORCHID TREE1
Edward F. Gilman, Dennis G. Watson, Ryan W. Klein, Andrew K. Koeser, Deborah R. Hilbert, and Drew C. McLean 2
INTRODUCTION
The fast-growing white orchid tree grows 20- to 40-feet in height with a 25- to 35-foot-spread, the slender trunks topped with arching branches clothed in large, two-lobed, deciduous leaves. In fall, before the leaves drop, white Orchid tree is festooned with many showy and delightfully fragrant, three to five-inch-wide, purplish to white, Orchid-shaped blossoms. These flowers appear on Orchid trees from January to April and are a beautiful sight to see. The flowers are followed by 6 to 9-inch-long, slender, brown, flat seedpods, which usually persist on the tree throughout the winter. This spectacular display makes Orchid tree a favorite for specimen and street-tree plantings.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
White Orchid tree should be grown in full sun on well-drained soil. Trees are very drought-tolerant and actually flower best on dry soils. Problems include a tendency to show nutritional deficiencies, especially potassium; the weak wood which is susceptible to breakage in storms; the abundant seedlings which may germinate in the landscape; and the litter problem created by the falling leaves, flowers, and seedpods. Orchid tree may need occasional pruning to develop a uniform shape when it is young. Branches tend to develop low on the trunk and droop toward the ground forming a large bush if left unpruned. Occasional pruning during the life of the tree will help maintain a nice, neat appearance.

PESTS
Caterpillars, mites, and borers.

DISEASES
Leaf spot, leaf scorch, and mushroom root rot diseases.
