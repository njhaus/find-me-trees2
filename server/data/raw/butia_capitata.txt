Pindo Palm1
Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2
INTRODUCTION
This cold-hardy, single-trunked palm is easily
recognized by its rounded canopy of blue-grey,
strongly-recurved, graceful fronds which curve in
toward the trunk (Fig. 1). The heavy, stocky trunks
are covered with persistent leaf bases. Large, showy
clusters of orange-yellow, juicy, edible fruits, the size
of large dates, are produced and often used to make
jams or jellies. The fruit, ripening in summer, can be
messy on sidewalks or patios, so you may want to
plant 10 feet away from the walk or patio. This slowgrowing palm eventually will reach 20 feet tall and is
attractive as a freestanding specimen or grouped with
other palms. Most are seen smaller than this since
growth rate is very slow. Plant 10 feet apart as a
street tree and they can be planted beneath power lines
due to slow growth and small size.

Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: not particularly outstanding
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Verticillium wilt susceptibility: not known to be
susceptible
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Growing in full sun or part shade on a wide
variety of soils, including alkaline, pindo palm is
moderately salt-tolerant. Pindo palm can survive hot,
windy conditions, asphalt and concrete areas but looks
better in good soil with adequate moisture. Some
people do not consider this a pretty palm but it
certainly will grow anywhere.
Propagation is by seed which take many months
for germination.
Pests
Palm leaf skeletonizer, scale, and micronutrient
deficiencies (especially Mn and Fe) are occasional
problems for pindo palm. Micronutrient deficiencies
only show up on soil with a high pH.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern. The roots and
lower trunk can rot if soil is kept too moist.
