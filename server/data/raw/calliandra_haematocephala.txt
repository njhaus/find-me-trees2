INTRODUCTION
This large, multiple trunked, low-branching,
evergreen shrub has silky leaflets which are glossy
copper when new, turning to a dark metallic green
(Fig. 1). The profuse, fragrant bloom is the main
reason for its popularity, with big puffs, two to three
inches across, of watermelon pink, deep red, or white
silky stamens, produced during warm months.

Trunk and Branches
Trunk/bark/branches: bark is thin and easily
damaged from mechanical impact; droop as the tree
grows, and will require pruning for vehicular or
pedestrian clearance beneath the canopy; routinely
grown with, or trainable to be grown with, multiple
trunks; not particularly showy; no thorns

strong structure

tree grows in full sun
Soil tolerances: clay; loam; sand; slightly alkaline;
acidic; well-drained
Drought tolerance: high
Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: tree has winter interest due to
unusual form, nice persistent fruits, showy winter
trunk, or winter flowers

Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Figure 3. Foliage of Powderpuff.
With rapid growth in sandy soils and full sun,
Powderpuff bush will respond favorably to regular
watering while young but should require no special
care once established except an occasional pruning to
keep it within bounds. Powderpuff bush may be used
as a tall (five to six-foot) flowering hedge and is often
seen as a small, flowering specimen tree with the
lower branches pruned off. Powderpuff can grow to
about 15 feet tall when pruned into a small tree. The
long, arching branches form an attractive canopy
suitable for patio or container plantings. Pinching the
new growth increases branch number and produces
more flowers on a more compact plant.
Although plants are damaged by freezing
temperatures, they grow back from the base in the
spring in USDA hardiness zone 9.
Propagation is by seed or cuttings.
The cultivar ‘White’ has snow-white flowers.
Pests
While usually pest-free, Powderpuff bush can be
occasionally infested by mites, caterpillars, or other
chewing insects.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern.
