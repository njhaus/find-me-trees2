INTRODUCTION
This large, multiple trunked, low-branching,
evergreen shrub has silky leaflets which are glossy
copper when new, turning to a dark metallic green
(Fig. 1). The profuse, fragrant bloom is the main
reason for its popularity, with big puffs, two to three
inches across, of watermelon pink and white silky
stamens, produced during warm months.

Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Figure 3. Foliage of Pink Powderpuff.
With rapid growth in sandy soils and full sun,
Powderpuff bush will respond favorably to regular
watering while young but should require no special
care once established except an occasional pruning to
keep it within bounds. Pinching new growth increases
the number of branches and enhances flower display.
Powderpuff bush may be used as a tall (five to sixfoot) flowering hedge and is often seen as a small,
flowering specimen tree with the lower branches
pruned off. Powderpuff can grow to about 15 feet tall
when pruned into a small tree. The long, arching
branches form an attractive canopy suitable for patio
or container plantings.
Although plants are damaged by freezing
temperatures, they grow back from the base in the
spring in USDA hardiness zone 9.
Propagation is by seed or cuttings.
Pests
While usually pest-free, Powderpuff bush can be
occasionally infested by mites, caterpillars, or other
chewing insects.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern.
