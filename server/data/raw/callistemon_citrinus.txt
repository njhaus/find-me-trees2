INTRODUCTION
The common name, "bottlebrush", perfectly
describes this evergreen plantâ€™s bright red flower
spikes (Fig. 1). Hummingbirds love the flowers, and
the plant is hardier than most Bottlebrushes. The
flowers are followed by small, woody capsules that
look like bead bracelets on the bark, and which last for
years. Offered as a shrub, Bottlebrush can be trained
as a tree to 15 feet or espaliered as a quick wall cover.
It makes a nice screen or tall unclipped hedge.
Pruning to develop several trunks and removing some
lower branches can create a fine small specimen tree.

clearance beneath the canopy; routinely grown with, or
trainable to be grown with, multiple trunks; not
particularly showy; no thorns

a strong structure
Breakage: resistant

well-drained
Drought tolerance: high
Aerosol salt tolerance: moderate

Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: not particularly outstanding
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Verticillium wilt susceptibility: not known to be
susceptible
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
A good choice for a spot offering full sun, it will
adapt to a variety of soils. Very drought-tolerant once
established, Bottlebrush tolerates any soil except very
poor, alkaline, or poorly-drained. Fertilize regularly to
maintain good flower color and dark green foliage.
Suckers from the trunk need to be removed
periodically to maintain tree form.
Propagation is usually from cuttings as it is
variable when grown from seed.
Pests
No particular insect pests are listed for
Callistemon.
Diseases
If the soil is too moist, root and crown-attacking
fungus diseases can be a problem. Prevention is your
best hope--keep the plant on the dry side with low
fertility and good air circulation.
A twig gall, formed in response to a fungus
(Sphaeropsis tumefacens), can disfigure the tree.
Chlorosis, a systemic condition which causes new
leaves to turn yellow, can be corrected with treatment
of the soil using iron sulfate or iron chelate.
