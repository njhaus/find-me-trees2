INTRODUCTION
This upright, pyramidal, densely foliated evergreen
tree can reach 60 feet in height in the forest with a 30
to 40-foot spread, but is generally much smaller
because it grows slowly (Fig. 1). This is an asset in
tropical landscapes, where many other plants grow so
fast. Greenish, showy, 3/4-inch, very fragrant flowers
are produced on eight-inch racemes in the summer.
The round, yellow, 1.5-inch-wide fruit contains a
single seed with a nutlike kernel that may be
poisonous. The seven-inch-long, glossy, dark green,
stiff, leathery leaves have numerous, distinct parallel
veins at right angles to the midrib. The trunk has light
grey, shallowly-ridged bark, and the wood is valued
for boat building and cabinet work.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Beauty Leaf makes a good specimen, street,
parking lot or shade tree and is both wind and salt
tolerant, making it especially useful for coastal
locations. It becomes twisted and contorted when
exposed to constant wind, creating an interesting
specimen. Beauty Leaf is sometimes used as a tall
hedge or wind break around tennis courts and similar
places. It could be used more often as an urban street
tree. Remember that the golfball-sized fruit is
poisonous and hard and this could be undesirable in
the landscape under some circumstances. The trunk
grows to about two feet in diameter.
Beauty Leaf thrives in full sun or partial shade on
any well-drained soil. It is not tolerant of freezing
temperatures.
Propagation is by seeds or cuttings.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases are of major concern.
