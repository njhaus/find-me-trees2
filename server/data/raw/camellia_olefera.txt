INTRODUCTION
Tea-Oil Camellia is so-named because they are
cultivated in their native homeland of China
specifically for the seeds, from which is extracted
commercial tea oil (Fig. 1). This particular Camellia
species looks much like Camellia sasanqua except the
dark green, evergreen leaves are a bit larger, three to
five inches long and two to three inches wide. Single,
white, fragrant flowers are produced in late winter, and
this large shrub or small tree will reach a height of 20
feet with thin, upright, multiple trunks and branches.
The crown forms a rounded or oval vase with lower
branches removed.

particularly showy; tree wants to grow with several
trunks but can be trained to grow with a single trunk;
no thorns

a strong structure

Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: tree has outstanding ornamental
features and could be planted more
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Plants should require little pruning and their dense,
compact, crown makes them ideally suited for informal
borders, specimens, accents, and sheared or natural
hedges or screens. Large specimens may be trimmed
to multi- or single-trunked small trees. This is a great
tree for planting along a street beneath power lines
since it will not require pruning by the utility
company, but unfortunately it is not yet readily
available. Nurseries should grow and market this plant
in a multi-stemmed and single-trunked form for this
purpose.
Tea-Oil Camellia should be grown in full sun or
partial shade on rich, moist, acid soils. It will tolerate
drought once established and grows well in clay soil.
Propagation is by seed or cuttings.
Pests
Watch for scale infestation.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern.
