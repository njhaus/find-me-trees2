INTRODUCTION
This fast-growing palm tree quickly grows to a
height of 40 feet, the smooth grey trunk topped with
10-foot-long, spreading green fronds (Fig. 1). The
inconspicuous white flowers appear from spring
through fall and are followed by the production of
bright red fruits which are less than one-inch-long.
The juice from these fruits can cause a skin irritation.
Once highly recommended as a replacement for the
Christmas Palm which is very susceptible to lethal
yellowing disease, Carpentaria Palm apparently
requires a richer soil than many landscapes can
provide. It is also susceptible to trunk cracks in cool
weather, a condition which opens the trunk to decay
organisms.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Carpentaria Palm is probably best suited for an
occasional accent or specimen planting where
temperatures stay warm in the winter. A number of
them grouped together can be attractive. Choose the
best soil on your site for planting this palm.
Carpentaria Palm should be grown in full sun on
rich, moist but well-drained, fertile soil, and it has a
low tolerance for salt and drought.
Propagation is by seeds.
Pests
Thrips.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern.
