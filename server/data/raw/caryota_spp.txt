INTRODUCTION
This clump-growing group of palms has medium
green leaf blades which are divided into many
segments, each of which resembles the tail of a fancy
goldfish (Fig. 1). Rarely exceeding 25 feet in height,
a number of species of fishtail palms produce suckers
from the base creating a very attractive specimen
palm. Its neat habit makes it ideal for use at poolside,
in urns or other containers, and it is often seen in welllit interiorscapes where its distinct form lends a
tropical effect. It can be used as a house plant in large
homes with plenty of light.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Fishtail Palms can thrive in light conditions from
full sun to deep shade, requiring only that its soil be
well-drained and reasonably fertile. It has a moderate
to rapid growth rate and should be located outdoors in
a sheltered location protected from cold.
Unfortunately, the palm is susceptible to lethal
yellowing disease. In addition, it is monocarpic so a
stem dies after it flowers. This stem must be removed
to maintain a neat appearance. There are a variety of
other species grown in south Florida nurseries.
Propagation is by seeds or division.
Pests
Red spider mites and scales are serious problems,
especially when fishtail palms are used indoors.
Diseases
Lethal yellowing disease.
