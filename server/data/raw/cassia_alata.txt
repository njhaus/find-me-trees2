INTRODUCTION
This large, spreading shrub from Argentina, very
tender to frost, produces from late summer to fall,
large spikes of golden-yellow flowers, opening from
bottom to top (Fig. 1). Flower spikes look like golden
candles when covered with unopened flower buds.
Reaching a height of 10 to 15 feet with an equal
spread, Candlebrush makes an attractive specimen
shrub or small tree if it is properly trained.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Figure 3. Foliage of Candlebrush.
Candlebrush grows rapidly in full sun on a wide
range of soils. Pinching new growth increases
branching, creating a fuller canopy which produces
more flowers. Candlebrush produces the nicest flower
display next year when it is pruned back hard in the
spring. It makes a beautiful accent in a shrub border
or planted as a specimen in a ground cover. Locate it
near the patio or by an entryway for a stunning fall
accent plant.
Propagation is by cuttings or seed, blooming the
first year from seed.
Pests
Caterpillars can cause a problem for Candlebrush,
eating the foliage and flower buds.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern.
