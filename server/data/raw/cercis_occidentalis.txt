INTRODUCTION
This small tree or shrub will usually grow several
trunks from its base unless properly pruned (Fig. 1). It
is native to California, Arizona and Utah, but grows
predominantly in California foothills below 4000 feet.
The temperature needs to drop below 28-degrees F. in
order for flowering to be profuse. The plant is not
grown in the eastern U.S.

several trunks but can be trained to grow with a single
trunk; no thorns

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Cercis are best propagated by seed. Use ripe seed
to plant directly, or, if seed has been stored,
stratification is necessary before sowing in a
greenhouse. Cultivars can be propagated by grafting
onto seedlings, or by summer cuttings under mist or in
a greenhouse.
Pests and Diseases
Probably similar to the pests affecting other
Redbuds.
