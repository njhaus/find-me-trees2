USE AND MANAGEMENT
Hinoki Falsecypress should be grown in full sun
on moist, well-drained soil, in areas of moderate to
high humidity, and preferably where the trees can be
protected from harsh winds. It is fairly free of pests
and diseases.
Propagation is by cuttings.
There are many cultivars, some quite dwarf.
Other cultivars have excellent foliage coloration or
unusual growth habit. Cultivars include: ‘Aurea’ -
golden foliage: ‘Caespitosa’ - rare, miniature, about six
inches tall; ‘Compacta’ - dwarf, about three feet tall,
dense, conical; ‘Coralliformis’ - branchlets reddish and
contorted; ‘Crippsii’ - broad pyramid with spreading
branches and golden foliage; ‘Erecta’ - columnar habit;
‘Ericoides’ - low, blue-gray foliage, ‘Filicoides’ -
fern-like; ‘Gracilis’ - compact growth habit, tips of
branchlets pendulous; ‘Kosteri’ - dwarf, three to four
feet tall, branch tips curved; ‘Mariesii’ - dwarf, foliage
variegated with yellowish white; ‘Nana’ - very dwarf,
height and spread of two feet; ‘Pygmaea’ - dwarf, two
feet tall, wider than tall; ‘Stoneham’ - slow, dwarf,
tiered branching; ‘Tetragona’ - slow, dwarf, erect.
Pests
Juniper scale can be controlled by applying
pesticides when the crawlers are active.
The bagworm webs dead foliage and other debris
together to make a nest. The covering makes the
insect difficult to control. The nests can be picked off
by hand.
Diseases
Blight can be a problem on young plants in
nurseries or old plants in landscape situations. In
young plants, branch tips turn brown and die back
until the whole branch or young tree is killed. Trees
over five years old are less susceptible. When older
trees in landscapes are affected by tip blight, entire
trees are seldom killed.
Tip blight can infect trees during wet weather.
The disease causes sooty pustules on the leaves, bark
and cones.
Scorch may look like a disease but is caused by
excessive direct sun, freezing stress, drought or mites.
Freezing stress can be prevented by shading small
plants in winter.
