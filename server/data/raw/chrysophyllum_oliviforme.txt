INTRODUCTION
Reaching a height of 40 feet and a spread of 20
feet in an oval form, Satinleaf is a medium-sized tree
noted for its unusually beautiful foliage (Fig. 1). The
evergreen, four-inch-long leaves are a glossy, dark
green above and a glowing, bright copper color
beneath, providing a beautiful, two-toned effect when
breezes cause the leaves to flutter. Leaves in some
respects resemble those of the brown-back Southern
Magnolias. This Florida native makes an attractive
freestanding lawn specimen or blends well in a
shrubbery border or naturalized landscape. It could be
tried as a street tree or parking lot tree. Use it
cautiously since it can be severely damaged at 32-
degrees F. and below. The trunks are rather showy
because they are covered with thin, light reddishbrown, scaly bark. Small, inconspicuous flowers are
followed by small, sweet, purple fruits.

Culture
Figure 3. Foliage of Satinleaf.
Light requirement: tree grows in part shade/part sun;
tree grows in full sun
Soil tolerances: clay; loam; sand; acidic;
occasionally wet; alkaline; well-drained
Drought tolerance: high
Aerosol salt tolerance: moderate
Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: tree has outstanding ornamental
features and could be planted more
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Satinleaf should be grown in full sun or partial
shade on fertile, well-drained soils. Plants should be
mulched and watered faithfully, although they are able
to withstand occasional drought. The tree has not
been widely planted but should make a good, durable
urban tree in USDA hardiness zones 10b and 11.
Trunk and branch structure is good, making this a
clean, long-lasting tree.
Star-apple, Chrysophyllum cainito, closely related,
bears leaves of similar decorative quality and is grown
for its larger (up to four inches long), more edible
fruits.
Propagation is by seed, or semi-hardwood cuttings
under mist.
Pests and Diseases
Caterpillars will occasionally chew the leaves, gall
mite can deform leaves, and leaf notcher chews leaves.
