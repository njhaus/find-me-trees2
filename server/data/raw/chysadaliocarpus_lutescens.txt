Yellow Butterfly Palm1
Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2
INTRODUCTION
This graceful, clump-growing palm reaches 20 to
30 feet in height with a spread of 8 to 10 feet (Fig. 1).
The gently arching, four to six-inch-wide, ringed,
bamboo-like, green, multiple trunks are topped with
curved, feathery, yellow-green fronds. Known under a
variety of names, this beautiful soft palm is quite
valued throughout the tropics and is widely planted in
frostfree areas. The small, white, inconspicuous
flowers are produced all year long on three-foot stalks
among the leaves, and the small, oblong, black fruits
ripen all year. Yellow Butterfly Palm makes an
attractive specimen, screening, or poolside planting but
it is overused.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Growing in full sun where it makes an excellent
specimen or screen (on four-foot-centers) to the rather
dense shade of patios, porches or as house plants,
Yellow Butterfly Palm prefers fertile, well-drained,
acid soil. Small palms benefit from some shade until
they are several feet tall and palms should be watered
during periods of drought. They require regular
fertilizer applications to maintain a good appearance.
Young palms in full sun and those in high pH soils
develop yellow leaves. Older leaves on plants of any
age become chlorotic, frequently from a deficiency of
potassium. Affected leaves are often speckled with
bronze or yellow. Yellow Butterfly Palm is
moderately salt-tolerant.
Propagation is by seeds or division.
Pests
Scales followed by sooty-mold can be a problem
for Yellow Butterfly Palm.
Diseases
Ganoderma root rot, potassium deficiency on older
leaves.
