INTRODUCTION
This dense, rounded, evergreen native tree grows
slowly to a height of 25 feet with an equal spread and
can develop a trunk 12 inches thick (Fig. 1). The
large, seven-inch-long, stiff, dark green leaves are
rough and hairy, feeling much like sandpaper.
Appearing throughout the year, but especially in spring
and summer, are dark orange, two-inch-wide flowers
which appear in clusters at branch tips. The splendid
flowers are followed by one to two-inch-long, pearshaped fruits, which have a pleasant fragrance but are
not particularly tasty.

Fruit characteristics: does not attract wildlife; suited
for human consumption; fruit, twigs, or foliage cause
significant litter; showy
Trunk and Branches
Trunk/bark/branches: bark is thin and easily
damaged from mechanical impact; droop as the tree
grows, and will require pruning for vehicular or
pedestrian clearance beneath the canopy; routinely
grown with, or trainable to be grown with, multiple
trunks; not particularly showy; tree wants to grow with
several trunks but can be trained to grow with a single
trunk; no thorns
Pruning requirement: requires pruning to develop
strong structure
Breakage: resistant
Current year twig color: brown
Current year twig thickness: medium
Wood specific gravity: 0.70

affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Geiger-Tree is quite salt- and brackish-water
tolerant, making it ideal for use in coastal landscapes
as a free-standing specimen, patio or framing tree.
Most specimens are seen as multitrunked and lowbranching but nurseries can produce single-trunked
trees suitable for downtown and parking lots. It has
been used as a street tree in some communities but
drops leaves as a drought-avoidance strategy in
prolonged dry spells. According to legend, the
common name was bestowed by Audubon in
commemoration of John Geiger, a Key West pilot and
wrecker of the 19th century and is now used quite
universally as the common name for this excellent
Florida native tree.
Growing in full sun to partial shade, Geiger-Tree
is tolerant of light, sandy, alkaline soils and salt-spray.
It is highly recommended for seaside plantings. Do
not plant where there is the slightest danger of frost.
Cordia boissieri is frost-resistant (tolerating
temperatures in the high 20â€™s) and has stunning white
flowers with yellow centers.
Propagation is by seeds or layering.
Pests
Mites, scales, and caterpillars will occasionally
attack Geiger-Tree. The geiger beetle defoliates the
tree upon occasion but the trees generally grow out of
it and do fine. The problem can be locally
troublesome.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern.
