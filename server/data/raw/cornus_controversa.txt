INTRODUCTION
Giant Dogwood, a fast-growing deciduous tree that
reaches 30 to 50 feet in height, eventually displays
attractive horizontal branches clothed in large, five to
eight-inch-long leaves, dark green above and
silver/green beneath, which turn a lovely red color in
the fall (Fig. 1). In the middle of springtime, the trees
produce a multitude of flat, white clusters of bloom in
dense cymes up to five inches across. These blooms
are followed by showy, blue/black berries which are
quite attractive to birds and other wildlife. The
branching pattern is more upright in youth, spreading
as it grows.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Giant Dogwood should be grown in full sun for
best flowering on moist, well-drained, acid soil. Used
most often as a patio or medium-sized shade tree,
Giant Dogwood has been planted as a street tree in
some communities and may be considered more
tolerant of urban soil than other dogwoods. It has
been the fastest growing dogwood at the North
Carolina State Arboretum.
The cultivar ‘Variegata’ has narrow, yellow-edged
leaves but is rare in cultivation.
Propagation is by cuttings with ease or seeds with
difficulty.
Pests
No pests are of major concern.
Diseases
Leaf spot, twig blight, or canker.
