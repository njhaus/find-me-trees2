INTRODUCTION
This small, spreading, deciduous tree has one to
five-inch-long, olive green leaves with paler undersides
(Fig. 1). During the summer months, Roughleaf
Dogwood produces many off-white, four-petaled, open
flowers, and these are followed by many small, round
fruits which ripen from August to October. Roughleaf
Dogwood forms a dense thicket of intertwined
branches, making it ideal for use as a hedge, border, or
as a cover for wildlife. At least forty species of birds
are known to feast upon the fruits.
