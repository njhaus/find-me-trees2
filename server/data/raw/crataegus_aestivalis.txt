INTRODUCTION
This slow-growing native North American tree
reaches a height of 30 feet with a rounded canopy that
spreads to 35 feet or more (Fig. 1). The dark green,
deciduous leaves are often three-lobed and have
red/brown undersides. The leaves display no
appreciable fall color. The sparkling white, showy
springtime flowers appear before the new leaves unfurl
and are followed by the production of large, red-dotted
fruits. The spreading, low branching habit of growth
makes this best suited for planting in a large open area
of turf. If regular pruning can be provided to keep
low, drooping branches pruned, it can be located
closer to a walk.

Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: not particularly outstanding

USE AND MANAGEMENT
May Hawthorn should be grown in full sun or
partial shade on well-drained, moist soils. According
to Dr. J. C. Raulston at North Carolina State
University, this may be one of the best Hawthorns for
the south due to superior disease resistance.
