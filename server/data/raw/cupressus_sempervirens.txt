Italian Cypress1
Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2
INTRODUCTION
With its narrow columnar habit of growth, this
evergreen forms tall, dark green columns 40 to 60 feet
in height in the western United States but are often
much shorter (Fig. 1). Trees are normally no more
than three feet wide. The scale-like leaves lend a very
fine texture to any setting. Planted three feet apart,
they make a dense screen. Italian Cypress is often
used for framing, as a strong accent around large
buildings, or in the formal landscape but does not lend
itself well to many home landscapes. It quickly grows
much too tall for most residential landscapes, looking
much like a green telephone pole.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Growing in full sun on various well-drained soils,
Italian Cypress should be planted in a well-prepared
site and watered periodically until well-established.
Italian Cypress should not be pruned. It is very
susceptible to mites and trees are often infested.
Many cultivars are available; ‘Glauca’ has bluegreen foliage and tight columnar form; ‘Stricta’ is very
popular; ‘Horizontalis’ has horizontally-spreading
branches.
Propagation is by cuttings or layering.
Pests
Bagworms are occasionally a problem for Italian
Cypress. Mites are often a problem.
Diseases
Root rot can be a problem for Italian Cypress in
poorly-drained soil. Canker is a devastating disease
that has killed many trees in California.
