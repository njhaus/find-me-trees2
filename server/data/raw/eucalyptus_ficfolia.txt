INTRODUCTION
A native of Australia, Eucalyptus ficifolia grows
best on the western coast of the United States and is
seldom successful in the interior (Fig. 1). Its flowers
are spectacular, and it can be tried as a container plant
in the north, wintered indoors. Foliage of Eucalyptus
is aromatic, with frequent distinguishing differences
between juvenile and mature leaves. These plants are
used in western landscapes.

or diseases which can affect tree health or aesthetics
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Propagation of Eucalyptus is by seed, using ripe
seed capsules taken off trees.
Pests
Pests of Eucalyptus include psyllids, aphids,
mealybugs, scales, mites, caterpillars and borers.
Spraying with soap solution or appropriate chemical
sprays will often suffice to control all but the borers.
Borer damage may require the cutting out and
destroying of infested stems and the removal of dying
plants. Psyllids disfigure the tree and can be quite a
problem.
Diseases
Eucalyptus are resistant to armillaria root rot and
to verticillium wilt. They are susceptible to powdery
mildew and to Phytophthora cinnamoni and
Phytophthora lateralis.
Leaf spot and crown gall are Eucalyptusâ€™ major
disease problems. Prune infected twigs and branches,
and be sure to keep dead leaves and fruit cleaned up
as plant refuse is usually the source of leaf spot
disease.
