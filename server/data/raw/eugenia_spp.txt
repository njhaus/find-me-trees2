INTRODUCTION
Eugenia is a large group of plants, some native
and some non-native, including evergreen trees and
shrubs, some of which have been reclassified to the
genus Syzygium (Fig. 1). The evergreen leaves are
firm and glossy, and the flowers white. It is the dried
buds of Eugenia aromatica (Syzygium aromaticum)
which become the fragrant "herb" cloves. The flowers
are followed by the production of berries, some types
of which are edible. All these traits - the attractive
foliage, flowers, and berries - help make Eugenia a
popular landscape choice in warm climate areas, such
as California, Florida, and Hawaii. Eugenia confusa
(Ironwood, Red Stopper) is native to Florida and
grows to about 35 feet and is well suited for street tree
and parking lot planting. Eugenia foetida (Spanish
Stopper) is also native and grows to about 15 feet tall.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
The smooth, brown to grey, mottled bark and tight
canopy of fine-textured leaves makes Eugenia well
suited for planting as a specimen in any yard. Trees
can be trained in the nursery to one central trunk or
allowed and encouraged to develop multiple trunks.
They create shade for a patio or deck, but will not
grow to the large, often overpowering size of a Ficus
tree. They are often used along streets, in highway
medians and in parking lots because they adapt to
small soil spaces and do not become very large. Street
and parking lot trees are often specified to have one
trunk to allow for vehicle clearance beneath the crown.
Multiple trunked trees are often specified for specimen
planting so the beautiful bark can be displayed.
Eugenia should be grown in full sun or part shade
on well-drained soil. Once established in the
landscape, they are drought tolerant requiring little, if
any, irrigation.
Propagation is by seeds or cuttings.
Pests
Psyllids limit the treeâ€™s usefulness in parts of
California.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern.
