INTRODUCTION
A 40 to 50-foot-tall, evergreen tree of uprightspreading, irregular growth, Fiddleleaf Fig produces 8
to 15-inch-long and 10-inch-wide, dull green, thick,
fiddle-shaped leaves which are quite attractive (Fig. 1).
The trunk can grow to several feet thick. Most trees
in the landscape are 15 to 25 feet tall. Larger ones
sometimes break apart in strong winds due to tight
branch crotches and embedded bark. Corrective
pruning early in the life of the tree can help prevent
this from occurring. Plant them in a place protected
from the wind, such as a courtyard to increase
longevity in the landscape.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Fiddleleaf Fig can be used in containers when
young or can be planted to make a striking specimen
tree. They create quite an accent by a patio or in
shrub bed because of the coarse leaf texture. Due to
their large size, the leaves can be a nuisance to some
people when they fall but there are never too many of
them.
Fiddleleaf Fig will grow moderately fast in full
sun or partial shade on any well-drained soil and
should receive regular watering. Be sure to cut roots
circling the container before planting since these can
cause the tree to become unstable as it grows older.
There are some aerial roots produced from the
branches but not as many as on some other Ficus, such
as Ficus benjamina.
Propagation is by layering and cuttings.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases are of major concern but
occasionally scales are a problem.
