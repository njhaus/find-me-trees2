INTRODUCTION
Capable of reaching a height of 40 feet but often
seen much shorter, this slow-growing palm has a slim,
six-inch-diameter, showy, green trunk (Fig. 1). The
trunk resembles bamboo. The graceful, dark green
fronds have a smooth, neat appearance, unencumbered
by spines or rough bark. Often used as an urn or
interior plant, Sentry Palm serves well as a small
framing or specimen tree in a shady location.
