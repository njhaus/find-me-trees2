INTRODUCTION
Torulosa Juniper grows into a narrow cone shape
when young, then opens up as the plant ages (Fig. 1).
Although the main body of its foliage is as thick as if
it had been sheared, delicately twisted, upright
branches emerge gracefully all around the plant, in
almost a flame-like manner. It may grow to 15 feet
tall in 15 years, perhaps leaning to one side in a
picturesque manner. Do not expect a row of them to
provide a uniform shape since crown form varies.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Torulosa Juniper develops into a showcase
specimen without pruning and is probably best used
for this purpose. Planted on four to six-foot centers, it
can develop into a thick screen which could be useful
along a driveway, where a narrow, bright green screen
is often needed to create privacy.
Growing best in full sun, more open in partial
shade, Torulosa Juniper needs well-drained soil or it
will decline from root rot. It tolerates alkaline soil and
is quite drought-tolerant but root regeneration is slow
after transplanting from a field nursery. It is
frequently offered in containers from a nursery.
Torulosa Juniper can be propagated by cuttings.
Pests
Mites and bagworms can infest the foliage.
Diseases
Torulosa Juniper is susceptible to root rot and
bacterial blight.
