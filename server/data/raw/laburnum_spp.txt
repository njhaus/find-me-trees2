Goldenchain Tree1
Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2
INTRODUCTION
This is an airy, graceful, deciduous tall shrub or
small tree, growing to a maximum of 20 to 25 feet,
with rich, yellow wisteria-like, drooping flower
panicles, up to 10 inches long, which appear in late
spring or early summer (Fig (Fig. 1). 1). The tree is
truly incredible in full bloom. It is difficult to grow
but if tried should be grown in a spot protected from
full day sun, with very well-drained, alkaline pH soil
and high organic matter. It tolerates alkaline soil but
not wet soil, and does not grow well in soil below pH
7.0.

affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Goldenchain Tree is a good specimen, patio or
border accent tree, and can also be espaliered against a
wall. In USDA hardiness zone 7, young plants are
extremely attractive but do not usually last long since
the plant does not tolerate heat well. All parts of the
plant are poisonous. Use as a novelty where a
brightly-colored accent is needed in the spring. Do
not overwater.
Laburnum alpinum is a related tree which is just
as beautiful in flower.
Pests
Tree can be attacked by aphids or mealy-bugs.
Diseases
Leaf spot, laburnum vein mosaic and especially
twig blight can be problems. Leaf-scald can also be a
problem where bark is exposed to afternoon sun in
winter. Root rot is also a problem in soil kept too
moist.
