INTRODUCTION
This attractive fruit tree has particularly handsome,
dark green, glossy, evergreen leaves, three to six
inches long, and forms a compact, round-headed
canopy (Fig. 1). New leaves are an attractive bronzered. Lychee trees can eventually reach 40 to 50 feet
in height with a 20-foot spread but will reach about 30
feet tall 30-years after planing in a landscape creating
a wonderful shade, framing, or specimen tree. Small,
yellow flowers appear in drooping, foot-long panicles
in early spring and are followed by clusters of
delicious, 1.5-inch-diameter fruit in late June and July.
When ripe, the warty outer surface of the fruit turns
bright red and becomes brittle. Easily peeled, the
interior sweet, juicy, white flesh surrounds a single,
large, glossy brown seed. The trees are quite
decorative when laden with fruit. Consider locating
the tree in the backyard if you are planting on a
residential lot. This will prevent passerbys from
helping themselves to the delectable fruit.

Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: tree has outstanding ornamental
features and could be planted more
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
The tree may be located near a patio, in a shrub
border, or as an accent in the lawn. The thick canopy
also makes it well-suited as a screen. Spaced 20 to 30
feet apart, they make a nice median or boulevard tree.
Easily grown in full sun on deep, fertile, welldrained soil, Lychee should be located where it can be
protected from strong winds. The dense canopy can
catch the wind and the tree can topple over in strong
wind. Proper thinning can help prevent this. Plants
should receive regular watering and fertilization, as
iron deficiency can show in alkaline soil.
Several named cultivars are available for best fruit
production: ‘Brewster’, ‘Mauritius’, ‘Sweet Cliff’,
‘Kate Sessions’, and ‘Kwai Mi’.
Propagation is by air-layering.
Pests
Scales.
Diseases
Mushroom root rot can be a problem on soils
where oaks were grown.
