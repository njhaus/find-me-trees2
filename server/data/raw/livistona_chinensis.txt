INTRODUCTION
Able to reach 50 feet in height but usually seen at
30 feet with a 10 to 12-foot spread, Chinese Fan Palm
has a single straight trunk and large, six-foot-long
leaves which have drooping tips (Fig. 1). The divided
leaves have long, tapering, ribbon-like segments which
gracefully sway beneath the leaves, creating an overall
fountain-like effect. The petioles are armed with sharp
spines. The inconspicuous flowers are hidden among
the leaves and are followed by small, blue-black,
olive-like fruits.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Although Chinese Fan Palm has long been used as
a container palm, its neat leaf habit and interesting
form make it ideal for further landscape uses, such as
in staggered groupings or used as a freestanding
specimen, or street tree. They form a closed canopy
when planted about ten feet apart along a walk or
street. They grow well in confined soil spaces. The
palm is self-cleaning of old leaves and will require
little or no pruning.
Tolerant of full sun, young specimens of Chinese
Fan Palm should be partially shaded. Any reasonably
fertile, well-drained soil, including alkaline, is suitable
and Chinese Fan Palm should be fertilized two or three
times during the year. Plants should be watered
during dry spells and will benefit from an organic
mulch.
Livistona chinensis subglobosa is a dwarf Chinese
Fan Palm.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests
Scales.
Diseases
It is moderately susceptible to lethal yellowing
disease.
