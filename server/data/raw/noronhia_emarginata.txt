INTRODUCTION
A very tough tree well-suited for coastal and
seaside locations, Madagascar Olive is an attractive,
upright oval, evergreen with six-inch-long, leathery,
olive green leaves and a high tolerance for salt and
wind (Fig. 1). The crown appears to stay well-formed
even right up on the coast where it is exposed to salt
spray. It reaches a height of 20 feet with a 15 to 20-
foot-spread. The inconspicuous but fragrant, small
yellow blooms are followed by one-inch-diameter,
bright yellow fruits, turning to dark purple, with a
sweet, edible, cream-colored flesh, which add to the
treeâ€™s ornamental value. The dropping fruit may be
undesirable to some people when planted near walks
or pavement, but properly located in a bed or lawn is
of little concern.

Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: not particularly outstanding
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Pest resistance: no pests are normally seen on the
tree
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Growing easily in full sun or partial shade,
Madagascar Olive is quite adaptable to a wide range of
soils. It works well as a dense screen or windbreak,
and can form an ideal specimen or framing tree for
landscapes with limited room after the lower branches
are removed. A cluster of trees creates a handsome,
informal grouping. This is a tough small tree which is
suitable for many locations. Use it to create shade on
a patio or grow it in a large, heavy container on a
deck. The small size makes it ideal for planting along
streets where there are overhead power lines.
Propagation is by cuttings or seed.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases are of major concern.
