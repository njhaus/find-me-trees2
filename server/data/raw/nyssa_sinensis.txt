INTRODUCTION
The deciduous Chinese Tupelo probably grows 35
to 50 feet tall and almost as wide in a rounded shape
(Fig. 1). Like many other Nyssa, young trees grow
with a pyramidal habit. The six-inch-long, green
leaves turn brilliant shades of red, yellow, and orange
in fall before dropping. Small, greenish-white flowers
appear in the spring in axillary clusters and are
followed by small blue fruits. These are visible when
they drop and stain sidewalks for a period of time but
they wash away quickly following a rain.
