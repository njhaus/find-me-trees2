PAULOWNIA TOMENTOSA: PRINCESS-TREE1
Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson 2
INTRODUCTION
This native of China gives a most dramatic, coarse-textured appearance, with its huge heart-shaped leaves and large clusters of lavender flowers in the spring. Flowers are borne before leaf emergence so they stand out nicely, especially against an evergreen background. With a rapid growth rate, Princess-Tree can reach 50 feet in height with an equal spread in an open landscape. Most trees are seen 30 to 40 feet tall and wide. It thrives best in deep, moist but well-drained soil, sheltered from the wind, and has become naturalized in many parts of the South. Fuzzy, brown flower buds form in early autumn, persist over the winter, and bloom in early spring. Buds may freeze in very cold weather and drop off. Woody seed capsules form in autumn containing up to two-thousand seeds. They persist through the winter. Seeds germinate readily in the landscape and wherever they are carried. Leaves drop within one week following the first frost in autumn.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Close-grained Paulownia wood has become extremely valuable during the last 15 years. It may be the highest priced saw timber in the country at this time. It is exported to Japan where it is milled into furniture and jewelry boxes. The wood is very lightweight and makes good crating material.

Princess-Tree should be planted where falling flowers and leaves are not objectionable. In some areas, the tree is often considered a "weed" tree, and has naturalized in the edge of woodlands. If it is planted, consider placing it in a park or other open-space area.

DISEASES
It has no known insect enemies.

There have been occasional reports of problems with mildew, leaf- spot and twig canker.
