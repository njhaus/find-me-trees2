INTRODUCTION
One of the finest of the dwarf palms, Pygmy Date
Palm slowly reaches 6 to 12 feet in height and has an
upright or curving, single trunk topped with a dense,
full crown of gracefully arching, three-foot-long leaves
(Fig. 1). The insignificant flower clusters, hidden by
the foliage, are present periodically throughout the
year and produce small, jet-black dates which ripen to
a deep red. Pygmy Date Palm is quite popular as a
specimen planting or in containers, especially attractive
at poolside. It is usually used as a single specimen
although it is also effective in groups of three or more.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Pygmy Date Palm should only be grown in frostfree areas in sun or shade on well-drained soils.
Plants should be regularly watered. Magnesium or
potassium deficiency symptoms (chlorotic and spotted
older fronds) often develop on the older leaves when
grown in soils with a pH above 7. It has some salt
tolerance, surviving on the inland side of coastal
condominiums.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests
Palm leaf skeletonizer and a large number of
scales can infest this palm.
Diseases
Leaf spot and bud rot are two diseases which can
infect this palm.
