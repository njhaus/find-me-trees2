INTRODUCTION
Widely planted for its attractive, bright-red, new
leaf growth, Japanese Photinia is a densely-foliated,
broadleaf evergreen which grows 15 to 20 feet in
height (Fig. 1). Bright red leaves among the dark
green ones afford a bit of foliage interest throughout
the fall and winter in southern climates (USDA
hardiness zones 8 and 9). The fragrant, four-inch-wide
flower clusters appear in early spring and are followed
by somewhat showy, red berries which ripen to black.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Often used as a hedge or dense screen, Japanese
Photinia can easily be trained into a multi-trunked
small tree for patio or specimen use. It is occasionally
sold as a standard, with all the branches originating
from the top of a four to five-foot-tall straight trunk.
Photinia does not make a good clipped hedge because
it will not keep foliage on the lower branches, grows
too rapidly and does not branch enough. But it will
form a nice tall screen. It can be used to frame a
residential street by planting properly trained
specimens on 10 to 15 foot centers. Although the red
foliage color contrasts well in most applications,
landscape designers avoid planting it against a red
brick wall because it clashes with brick.
Growing best in full sun on moist, organic soils,
Photinia grows rapidly and is very tolerant of hard
pruning.
The cultivar ‘Rubens’ has bright, bronze-red
young leaves.
Propagation is by cuttings.
Pests
Mites, scales, aphids, and caterpillars are
occasional pests but do no major damage.
Diseases
It is susceptible to fire blight and leaf spot which
can cause serious defoliation. Be sure to locate plants
in full day sun to help prevent these devastating
diseases.
