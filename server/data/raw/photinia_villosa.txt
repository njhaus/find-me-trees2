Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2
INTRODUCTION
This deciduous shrub or small tree reaches 15 to
18 feet in height with a spread of 10 feet (Fig. 1).
The irregular, upright-spreading, oval, dense crown is
composed of one to three-inch-long leaves which
display great variety of color throughout the year.
New leaves unfold as pale glimmers of sunlight
brushed with pink, mature to a healthy dark green
throughout the summer, then change to yellow, bronze,
and vivid red in the autumn. Small, flat clusters of
white flowers join the dark green leaves in late May
and are followed in October by bright red berries,
which persist on the plant into the winter, if not
devoured by birds.

Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: tree has winter interest due to
unusual form, nice persistent fruits, showy winter
trunk, or winter flowers
Outstanding tree: tree has outstanding ornamental
features and could be planted more
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Verticillium wilt susceptibility: susceptible
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Its upright form, irregular branching structure, and
attractive berries make Oriental Photinia an attractive
planting choice for the winter garden, specimen use, or
for the mixed shrubbery border. It could also be used
as a street tree if it were pruned correctly. It would be
recommended for extensive planting if it were not for
fireblight disease. Therefore, it is probably best used
as a small tree mixed into a shrub border or in limited
numbers in urban plantings. It should be tried in areas
where fireblight is not a problem.
Oriental Photinia should be grown in full sun or
partial shade on well-drained, acid soil.
Propagation is by cuttings or seed.
Pests
No pests are of major concern. Some caterpillars
chew foliage and there may be occasional scale
infestations.
Diseases
Oriental Photinia is susceptible to leaf spot,
powdery mildew, and seriously damaged by fire blight.
