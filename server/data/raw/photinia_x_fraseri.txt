INTRODUCTION
Growing 12 to 18 feet high by 8 to 12 feet wide,
Fraser Photinia forms an upright silhouette of glossy,
evergreen leaves (Fig. 1). One of the most striking
features of Fraser Photinia is the burgundy-red new
foliage which contrasts nicely against the dark green
mature foliage. Most people do not see the showy
white flower clusters borne at the ends of the branches
in the summer because they regularly prune the new
growth. It is really quite attractive in flower, as the
entire crown fills with white for two or three weeks.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Ideal for use as a clipped hedge or screen (if you
donâ€™t mind the bottom of it being on the thin side),
Fraser Photinia produces some attractive new red
growth all throughout the growing season in USDA
hardiness zones 8 and 9. Unfortunately, everyone
seems to have discovered the plant and everyone has
one (or many) but most people use it as a hedge. Try
it as a tree for something different. It is best used as a
tall screen in the full sun but is often misused as a
foundation plant in front of the house. It grows fine in
the shade but leaf spot is sure to follow causing
defoliation and disappointment (or jubilation
depending upon your persuasion).
Fraser Photinia needs well-drained soil and a full
sun location. Leaves often become infected with leaf
spot fungi when grown in shade or when the leaves
remain too moist. Plants grow at a moderate rate and
tolerate pruning very well, although the bottom of the
plant often thins when clipped into a hedge. There are
better plants for hedges. Micro-nutrient problems
occur on alkaline soil, although plants continue to
grow. It tolerates heat well and is suited for exposed
sites like parking lots and median strips in highways.
Propagation is by cuttings.
Pests
Caterpillars, mites, scales, European fruit-tip moth
can be found on photinia but are often of little
consequence.
Disease
Fire blight kills the plant rather quickly, leafspot
diseases are very serious, and mildew. Root rot can
kill plants, particularly those in wet soils. This is not
a pest-free plant.
