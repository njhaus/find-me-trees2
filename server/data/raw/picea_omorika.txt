INTRODUCTION
A narrow, pyramidal silhouette with thin, graceful
arching branches (Fig. 1). The trunk grows straight
and the tree requires no pruning to keep the narrow,
pyramidal form. The upper surface of the needles is
glossy, dark green. The lower surface is marked with
two white stomata lines. The plant will grow about 50
feet tall and spread 20 feet and is one of the most
elegant Spruces.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
This tree is best used as a specimen, wind break,
screen, or perhaps as an evergreen street tree for
narrow overhead spaces. It is surprisingly tolerant of
urban conditions, probably more so than other Spruces.
Grows best with some shelter from mid-day or
afternoon sun, though it tolerates full-day sun. Also
tolerates soils with a high pH.
Pests
Bagworms make a sack by webbing needles and
debris together. Small numbers may be picked off by
hand or use Bacillus thuringiensis. Usually not
serious.
In northern areas, Spruce budworm larvae feed on
developing buds and young needles. The yellowish
brown caterpillars are difficult to see.
The Spruce needle miner makes a small hole in
the base of a needle then mines out the center. Dead
needles are webbed together and can be found on
infested twigs.
Spider mites can be problem in summer after hot
dry weather. The small insects canâ€™t be readily seen
with the naked eye. The first noticeable symptoms are
yellowing of the oldest needles on infested branches.
Close inspection with a magnifying glass will confirm
the presence of the mites.
Sawfly larvae may feed on the needles. One
infestation will usually not kill the tree.
Diseases
Spruce may be attacked by needle casts causing
needles to turn yellow or brown and drop off.
Another needle cast affects the lowest needles first
then moves up the tree. Infected needles are a mottled
yellow.
Several rust diseases attack Spruce but these are
rarely seen. Infected needles turn yellow and drop off.
