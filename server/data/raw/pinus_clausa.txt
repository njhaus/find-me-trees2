INTRODUCTION
This native North American pine is usually seen as
a scrubby tree, capable of reaching 100 feet in height
but more often seen 15 to 40 feet tall, with a slow
growth rate (Fig. 1). The supple, evergreen leaves and
the plantâ€™s ability to thrive in almost any soil make
Sand Pine a good choice for use as a Christmas tree,
with proper shearing. The 2 to 3.5-inch-long, spiny
cones persist for quite a while on the tree, often
becoming embedded in the wood of the twigs.

Trunk and Branches
Trunk/bark/branches: droop as the tree grows, and
will require pruning for vehicular or pedestrian
clearance beneath the canopy; not particularly showy;
should be grown with a single leader; no thorns
Pruning requirement: needs little pruning to develop
a strong structure
Breakage: susceptible to breakage either at the crotch
due to poor collar formation, or the wood itself is
weak and tends to break
Current year twig color: brown

tree grows in full sun
Soil tolerances: clay; loam; sand; slightly alkaline;
acidic; well-drained

Soil salt tolerance: good
Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: not particularly outstanding
Invasive potential: seeds itself into the landscape
Verticillium wilt susceptibility: not known to be
susceptible
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
The trunks on Sand Pine are rarely straight. The
tree usually grows with a portion of the crown missing
or with a lean to one side. This may contribute to the
unpopularity of the tree in the landscape trade.
However, this attribute can make it well suited for
planting as an accent in any large scale landscape. It
is especially useful and attractive when planted in a
lawn area as a single specimen. It certainly has its
place in reclamation sites as a colonizer of poor soils.
The tolerance to dry, sandy soils should make this tree
adaptable to conditions created near asphalt and other
hot areas in urban landscapes.
Sand Pine should be grown in full sun on any
well-drained soil. The tree is highly drought- and salttolerant.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases are of major concern.
