INTRODUCTION
Just as its name implies, Umbrella Pine has a
broad, somewhat flattened round canopy, and the tree
will ultimately reach 80 to 100 feet in height though it
is more often seen at 35 to 45 feet tall and wide (Fig.
1). The bright green, stiff, six-inch-long needles are
arranged in slightly twisted bundles, and are joined by
the heavy, five to six-inch-long cones which remain
tightly closed on the tree for three years. The trunk is
showy with narrow, foot-long orange plates set off
nicely by darker fissures.

or diseases which can affect tree health or aesthetics
USE AND MANAGEMENT
It is the seeds inside the cones which are of
particular interest, called pignolia or Pine nuts in the
stores. The closed cones are gathered, then laid out in
the direct sun which forces them to open so the seeds
can be harvested. Eaten raw or roasted like peanuts,
pignolia nuts are a traditional ingredient of certain
Italian dishes. In fact, the tree is native to southwest
Europe around the Mediterranean to Greece and Asia
Minor, and remains of the cones have been discovered
in Roman camps in Britain attesting to their long-time
popularity.
Umbrella Pine has not been extensively tried as a
street tree except in parts on California where it has
done well, but has the attributes of an urban tolerant
tree. Drought and salt tolerance is high making it
suited for areas such as western Texas and Olkahoma.
Grows well in soil with a pH in the mid 7â€™s or lower,
but may do poorly with higher pH. Umbrella Pine
should be grown in full sun on well-drained soil.
Winter winds and low temperature in USDA hardiness
zone 7a cause needles to brown and they remain
unsightly all winter.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests
There are a a large number of pests on Pine.
Diseases
This tree is usually disease-free.
