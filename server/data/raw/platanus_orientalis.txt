INTRODUCTION
This deciduous tree is one of the parents of the
popular London Planetree (Platanus x acerifolia) and
has more deeply lobed leaves than its offspring (Fig.
1). Leaves are almost maple-like. Capable of
reaching 80 feet in height, the Oriental Planetree has
very strong branches and is quite useful as a shade
tree. The wood is so tough, dense and hard it is often
used for butcherâ€™s blocks and furniture. The
springtime flowers are followed by fruits which are
found on stalks in groups of three to 6. The attractive
bark is cream colored and flaky and very striking in
the winter.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
It was widely planted in many northern cities but
bacterial leaf scorch and canker stain have killed many
trees in these communities. If this tree is planted, do
so with moderation to avoid these unfortunate
problems.
Naturally found along streams and floodplain
riverbeds, Oriental Planetree should be grown in full
sun or partial shade on moist soils. It grows on acid
or alkaline soil, wet or dry. Leaves may drop early in
dry years. Should be grown primarily for its
resistance to anthracnose disease which can be
devastating to American Sycamore, but it is now rare
in the trade in the United States.
Pests and Diseases
Canker stain and stem canker can severely weaken
or kill trees. Anthracnose can be serious in wet years,
although this Planetree is more resistant than American
Sycamore. Probably lace bug, and others.
