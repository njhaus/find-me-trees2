INTRODUCTION
Frangipani is well-known for its intensely fragrant,
lovely, spiral-shaped, reddish blooms which appear at
branch tips June through November (Fig. 1). The tree
itself is rather unusual in appearance; the 12 to 20-
inch-long, coarse, deciduous leaves cluster only at the
tips of the rough, blunt, sausage-like, thick, grey-green
branches. Branches are upright and rather crowded on
the trunk forming a vase or umbrella shape with age.
They are rather soft and brittle and can break but are
usually sturdy unless they are mechanically hit or
disturbed. The crown loses its leaves for a short time
during the winter displaying the coarse-textured,
stubby branches. A milky sap is exuded from the
branches when they are bruised or punctured.

Leaf arrangement: alternate (Fig. 3)
Leaf type: simple
Leaf margin: entire; undulate
Leaf shape: elliptic (oval); obovate
Leaf venation: banchidodrome; pinnate
Leaf type and persistence: deciduous
Leaf blade length: 12 to 18 inches; 8 to 12 inches
Leaf color: green
Fall color: red
Fall characteristic: not showy
Flower
Flower color: pink; red
Flower characteristics: fall flowering; pleasant
fragrance; spring flowering; summer flowering; very
showy
Fruit
Fruit shape: elongated
Fruit length: 6 to 12 inches
Fruit covering: dry or hard
Fruit color: brown
Fruit characteristics: does not attract wildlife;
inconspicuous and not showy; no significant litter
problem; persistent on the tree
Trunk and Branches
Trunk/bark/branches: bark is thin and easily
damaged from mechanical impact; droop as the tree
grows, and will require pruning for vehicular or
pedestrian clearance beneath the canopy; routinely
grown with, or trainable to be grown with, multiple
trunks; not particularly showy; tree wants to grow with
several trunks but can be trained to grow with a single
trunk; no thorns
Pruning requirement: requires pruning to develop
strong structure
Breakage: susceptible to breakage either at the crotch
due to poor collar formation, or the wood itself is
weak and tends to break
Current year twig color: brown; green
Current year twig thickness: stout

Culture
Light requirement: tree grows in part shade/part sun;
tree grows in full sun
Soil tolerances: clay; loam; sand; acidic; alkaline;
well-drained
Drought tolerance: high
Aerosol salt tolerance: high
Soil salt tolerance: moderate
Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: tree has winter interest due to
unusual form, nice persistent fruits, showy winter
trunk, or winter flowers
Outstanding tree: tree has outstanding ornamental
features and could be planted more
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Frangipani is very susceptible to freezing
temperatures and should be adequately protected or
planted only in areas which do not freeze in the
winter. Plants will grow quickly in full sun on a
variety of well-drained soils and is fairly drought and
salt tolerant. Reaching a height of 20 to 25 feet with
an equal spread, Frangipani works well as a
freestanding specimen, a patio tree, or as part of a
shrubbery border. It displays well in a front yard as
an attention-grabber by the entrance. It can be grown
with a single trunk or branched low to the ground into
a multi-trunked specimen. Single-trunk specimens
could be planted as median or street trees on 15 to 20-
foot-centers.
While Plumeria rubra produces red-toned flowers,
other species offer a variety of colors. Plumeria alba
has white flowers. Plumeria obtusa has white blooms
centered in yellow and is variable in form and color.
There are other species and cultivars.
Propagation is by cuttings. Large hardwood
cuttings should be allowed to dry several days while
leafy tip cuttings should be planted immediately.
Plants flower at an early age.

Pests
Some common pests are scales, frangipani
caterpillar, and nematodes.
Diseases
Root rot can infect plants planted in soils with
poor drainage.
