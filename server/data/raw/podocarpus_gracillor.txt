INTRODUCTION
This 30 to 50-foot evergreen has a soft, graceful,
billowy appearance of bright green new growth, dark
green mature leaves, and weeping branch tips (Fig. 1).
If left unpruned the lower branch tips will touch the
ground and the tree will appear as a stack of foliage
emerging from the earth. With lower limbs removed a
rounded vase shape or oval emerges creating dense
shade beneath. Often used as an espalier, Fern
Podocarpus is quite striking when used as a specimen,
shade tree, or screening plant. It can make a beautiful
street or parking lot tree but lower branches need to be
removed with time as the tree grows since they tend to
droop and could hinder traffic visibility. But this is a
small price to pay for this wonderful tree. This is a
tough plant which can grow very well in urban
conditions. The trunk will slowly grow to be two feet
in diameter or larger. Very adapted to downtown,
restricted-soil planting sites, the roots rarely lift
sidewalks or cause other problems.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Used as a large patio tree, the fine-textured foliage
is sure to draw a complimentary remark from visitors
and friends. Almost appearing like a large, soft, green
cloud, Fern Podocarpus creates a beautiful effect when
placed beside a pond or other water interest. The tree
combines well with Yellow Lantana or other lowgrowing yellow flowering ground covers planted under
the tree. It compliments glass-sided structures well, its
soft foliage shimmering and reflecting on a breezy,
sunny day.
Growing in full sun or partial shade, it will
tolerate a wide range of well-drained soils and should
be protected from frost. In Florida, it is considerably
tolerant of dry soils requiring no irrigation once
established.
Propagation is by cuttings or layerings.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases are of major concern. A very
durable, low-maintenance tree which should be grown
by nursery operators for use in urban and suburban
landscapes.
