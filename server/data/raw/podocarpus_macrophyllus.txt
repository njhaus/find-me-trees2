INTRODUCTION
With densely foliated lower limbs which reach the
ground and neat, dark green, evergreen leaves,
Podocarpus is very popular as a dense screen or hedge
(Fig. 1). However, Podocarpus can reach 40 to 50 feet
in height when not sheared and is quite attractive as a
tree with the lower branches removed, revealing the
light brown, peeling bark. If space permits, leave the
lower limbs on the tree for an almost spruce-like
appearance. The tree grows in an open manner with
large spaces between the branches creating a pleasing,
irregular oval silhouette in middle and old age. The
inconspicuous flowers are followed by fleshy, purple,
small, edible fruits (very good to eat) on female trees
which are quite attractive to birds but not really messy
on sidewalks or pavement.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
This is one of a few trees which can be pruned
into a nice hedge. The dark green foliage and dense
growth creates a formal mass. It looks better when
pruned with a hand pruner, not sheared with a hedge
trimmer.
Showing best growth and form in full sun,
Podocarpus will grow more slowly and have a looser
appearance when grown in shade. It will grow on the
north side of a tall building with little or no direct sun.
It will tolerate a wide variety of well-drained, acidic
soils. Donâ€™t plant on wet soils. This is a tough tree,
adaptable to urban conditions and should be used
much more extensively as a street tree. It should be
used more in areas of poor soils and restricted rooting
space. Unfortunately, most people choose to trim the
tree into a column or hedge, so not many have seen
the true beauty of the tree. It will make an attractive
specimen, street or parking lot tree, even for the
smallest soil space in a downtown planting pit. Roots
are not a problem in restricted-soil planting areas and
usually do not lift sidewalks.
Many varieties are available for selection of habit,
leaf form, color, etc. Podocarpus macrophyllus var.
angustifolius is a narrow, columnar tree with curved
leaves, 2 to 4.5 inches long; Podocarpus macrophyllus
var. appressus is a low shrub with short leaves;
Podocarpus macrophyllus var. maki has erect
branches, columnar form, 1.5 to 3-inch-long leaves.
Propagation is by seeds or cuttings. Hardwood
cuttings root easily. Cutting propagation would ensure
more uniform trees than seedlings. Nursery operators
should be encouraged to grow Podocarpus in the
single-trunked tree form for planting in urban
landscapes.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases are of major concern.
Occasionally bothered by scale, mites, and sooty mold
but not seriously. Some magnesium-deficiency on
sandy soil, which is easily corrected with magnesium
sulfate.
