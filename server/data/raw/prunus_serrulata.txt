INTRODUCTION
Kwanzan Cherry has double-pink, very attractive
flowers and is usually purchased and planted for this
reason (Fig. 1). The upright-spreading form, reaching
15 to 25 feet tall, is quite attractive in many locations
including near a patio or as a specimen away from
lawn grass competition. The tree is glorious in flower
and has been planted along with Yoshino Cherry in
Washington, D.C., for the annual Cherry Blossom
Festival. Kwanzan Cherry has good yellow fall color,
does not bear fruit, but is troubled with pests. It
prefers full sun, is intolerant of poor drainage, and is
easily transplanted. However, useful life of the species
is limited to about 15 to 25 years for ‘Kwanzan’, on a
good site. But the tree is a joy during this short
period and should be planted.

Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: no special winter interest
Outstanding tree: tree has outstanding ornamental
features and could be planted more
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Verticillium wilt susceptibility: susceptible
Pest resistance: very sensitive to one or more pests
or diseases which can affect tree health or aesthetics
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Neither stress-tolerant or highly drought-tolerant,
Kwanzan Cherry should be located on a site with loose
soil and plenty of moisture. Not for an urban parking
lot or exposed street tree planting where borers and
other problems normally attack. It has some tolerance
to salt, and tolerates clay if well-drained.
There are many other cultivars of Oriental Cherry
but few are readily available. Some which may be
locally available include: ‘Amanogawa’(‘Erecta’) -
semi-double, light pink, fragrant flowers, narrow
columnar habit, about 20 feet tall; ‘Fugenzo’(‘James
H. Veitch’, ‘Kofugen’) - spreading habit, flowers 2.5
inches across, rose pink fading to light pink, double,
‘Kofugen’ sometimes described as having deeper
color; ‘Shirofugen’ - rapid growth rate, young foliage
bronze later turning green, flowers double, 2.5 inches
across, pink fading to white; ‘Shirotae’(‘Mt. Fuji’,
‘Kojima’) - flowers double to semi-double, white,
ruffled, about 2.5 inches across; ‘Shogetsu’ - tree 15
feet tall, broad and flat-topped, flowers double, pale
pink, center may be white, can be two inches across;
‘Ukon’ - young foliage bronze, flowers pale yellow,
semi-double.
Pests
Aphids cause distortion of new growth, deposits of
honeydew, and sooty mold.
Borers attack flowering cherries. Keep trees
healthy with regular fertilizer applications, and
irrigation during drought.
Scales of several types infest cherries.
Horticultural oil can be used to help control
overwintering stages.
Spider mites cause yellowing or stippling but they
are very difficult to see. They are usually noticed
after leaves begin showing severe symptoms.
Tent caterpillars make large webbed nests in trees
then eat the foliage. One defoliation may not be
serious and small nests can be pruned out and
destroyed. Use Bacillus thuringiensis when the insects
are first seen and are still small.

Diseases
A bacterium causes leaf spot and twig cankers on
cherry. Small, reddish spots dry, and drop out, giving
a shot holed appearance. Defoliation can be severe
when conditions favor disease development. Fertilize
infected trees and prune out infected branches.
Black knot causes black swellings or galls on the
branches. Branches with galls are pruned out.
Powdery mildew causes a white coating on the
leaves, but control is seldom, if ever, warranted.
