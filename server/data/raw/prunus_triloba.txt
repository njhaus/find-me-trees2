INTRODUCTION
Reaching a height of 12 feet with an equal spread,
Flowering-Almond has beautiful, double pink flowers
which appear in midspring (Fig. 1). It provides a
wonderful accent in a residential yard or courtyard
when in flower. Be sure to locate it in a groundcover
or mulched bed, as mechanical injury or stress of any
kind hasten the demise of this short-lived tree. It is
also very suitable in a shrub border as a tall accent. It
can be sculptured nicely into a unique form with
proper pruning and training and is well suited for
container gardening. Regular pruning is needed for
best flowering performance. Branches cut in early
spring can be forced into bloom indoors.

well-drained
Drought tolerance: moderate
Aerosol salt tolerance: none
Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem

features and could be planted more
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Ozone sensitivity: sensitive or moderately tolerant
Verticillium wilt susceptibility: susceptible
Pest resistance: very sensitive to one or more pests
or diseases which can affect tree health or aesthetics
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Flowering-Almond grows best in sun or partial
shade on rich, moist soil. Keep turf grass cleared
away from a four to six-foot diameter circle around the
tree. It transplants well and grows at a moderate pace.
‘Plena’ has double flowers; var. simplex has single
flowers sometimes followed by red fruit.
Pests
Aphids cause distortion of new growth, deposits of
honeydew, and sooty mold.
Borers attack trees under stress. Keep trees
healthy with regular fertilizer applications and
irrigation in drought.
Scales of several types infest Prunus spp.
Horticultural oil can be used to help control
overwintering stages.
Spider mites cause yellowing or stippling but are
very difficult to see. They are usually recognized only
after plant symptoms are quite advanced.
Tent caterpillars make large webbed nests in trees
then eat the foliage. One defoliation may not be
serious and small nests can be pruned out and
destroyed. Use Bacillus thuringiensis when the insects
are first seen and are still small.
Diseases
A bacterium causes leaf spot and twig cankers on
cherry. Small, reddish spots dry, and drop out, giving
a shot holed appearance. Defoliation can be severe
when conditions favor disease development. Fertilize
infected trees and prune out infected branches.
A fungus causes reddish spots which drop out
leaving shot holes. Once the hole appear the leaves
may drop. The disease is worse in wet weather.
Black knot causes black swellings or galls on the
branches. Branches with galls are pruned out.
Powdery mildew causes a white coating on the
leaves.
