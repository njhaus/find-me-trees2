INTRODUCTION
A native of the woods of the southeastern United
States, Flatwoods Plum is a round-topped, deciduous
tree, reaching 20 feet in height with a 15-foot spread,
that is most often planted for its spectacular display of
blooms (Fig. 1). It may look a little ragged in winter.
In late February, before the two-inch-long, finely
serrate leaves appear, these small trees take on a white,
billowy, almost cloud-like appearance when they are
clothed in the profuse, small, white flower clusters.
These half-inch blooms are followed by one-inch-long,
edible, purple fruits which vary in flavor from very
tart to sweet. These plums are very attractive to
various forms of wildlife.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Flatwoods Plum thrives in full sun or partial shade
on a wide variety of soils. When placed in sandy soil,
it grows best with irrigation and some shade in the
afternoon. Trees grow quickly when young but
considerably slower when mature and bearing fruit. A
bit weedy in growth habit, proper training and pruning
can create an attractive specimen or small median strip
or street tree, especially for planting beneath power
lines or in other areas were overhead space is limited.
Few root suckers form on this plant; many form on
Prunus angustifolia.
Do not expect a row of them to form a uniform
shape. The tree branches low to the ground making it
a nice tall element in a backyard shrub border. Lower
branches need to be removed in order to train as a
street tree. Small-diameter, interior branches can be
removed in winter to open up the crown for a more
formal, attractive shape and habit. May live 30 to 40-
years on a good site.
Propagation is by seed which must be stratified for
several months to germinate.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases are of major concern. Tent
caterpillars occasionally infest Flatwoods Plum.
