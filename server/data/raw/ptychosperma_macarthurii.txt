Macarthur Palm1
Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2
INTRODUCTION
This attractive small palm is noted for its multiple,
slim, ringed grey trunks which are topped with soft
green, feathery, flat, broad leaves with tips that appear
jagged and torn (Fig. 1). Although able to reach 30
feet in height, Macarthur Palm is most often seen 10
to 15 feet in height with a variable spread. The twofoot-long, branched flower stalks hang below the
crownshaft throughout the year and contain small,
white blooms. These blooms give way to bright red,
showy sprays of half-inch-long fruits which ripen yearround.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Macarthur Palm is often used in planters or urns
but quickly outgrows these containers. It makes a
striking lighted nighttime specimen, and is ideal for
accenting shaded, sheltered locations, such as
entranceways and patios. It is often planted in groups
with individual trees several feet apart.
Macarthur Palm prefers partial shade but will
tolerate full sun or dense shade on any well-drained
soil. Abundant moisture will allow it to look its best
because it will keep more leaves.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases are of major concern. This
palm is lethal yellowing-resistant. Sooty mold
sometimes coats the trunk.
