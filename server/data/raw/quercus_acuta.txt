Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2
INTRODUCTION
Japanese Evergreen Oak reaches 20 to 30 feet in
height with a 15 to 20-foot-spread and has an oval to
rounded silhouette with dense, low branching and
smooth, grey bark on the often multiple trunks (Fig.
1). The dark green, glossy leaves, 2.5 to 5 inches
long, have wavy-margins and a paler underside. New
growth is purplish-brown. The inconspicuous flowers
are followed by brown, cupped acorns. The dense
growth and small size make Japanese Evergreen Oak
ideal for use as a specimen, screen, or small shade
tree. Unfortunately, it is not available in nurseries.
