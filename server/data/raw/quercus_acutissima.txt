INTRODUCTION
Sawtooth Oak is an attractive, large, deciduous
tree, 50 feet in height or taller with a rounded, broad,
pyramidal shape (Fig. 1). The leaves are similar to
chestnut (Castanea) and have small bristles at the
edges. New spring leaves are an attractive bright
yellow-green and fall color varies from dull yellow to
brown. Brown leaves hang onto the tree into the
winter which makes the tree unattractive to some
people. The trunk and bark of Sawtooth Oak are
gray-brown and deeply furrowed. The trunk flares out
at the base lifting sidewalks and curbing if planted in
tree lawns less than eight feet wide or too close to
walks.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Sawtooth Oak prefers a well-drained, acid soil but
will adapt to most soils except highly alkaline. The
trunk remains straight and usually dominant over the
lateral branches forming a pyramidal shape in the early
years making this tree very suitable for urban planting.
Growth is rapidly adding three feet in height each year
after planting. As it ages, it grows into a broad,
rounded canopy that could make it useful as a shade
tree, street or parking lot tree or a lawn tree specimen.
It is largely untested as a street tree but deserves a
chance to show its urban adaptability. Lower branches
need to be shortened then removed early when
planting this as a street or parking lot tree since they
will droop toward the ground as the tree grows older,
requiring removal to allow for vehicular traffic. Leave
the more upright, spreading branches to create more
clearance beneath. Lower branches can be left on
trees grown in more open areas to allow for full
development of the picturesque, low branching, open
form. Multi-trunked specimens can reportedly break
up at about 25-years-old due to embedded bark and
poor attachment so maintain the central leader.
The acorns of Sawtooth Oak are large (1-inchlong) and are produced in large quantities in the fall.
They are quite popular with wildlife. The acorns may
cause a litter problem for some if the tree is located
near walkways, driveways or house gutters. But
squirrels and other wildlife love the acorns. Trees
grow best in well-drained soil in the full sun.
Irrigation helps trees become established but once
established, they grow very fast without irrigation.
This is one of the fastest growing trees in Auburnâ€™
shade tree trials.
Propagation of Oaks by seed is the most common.
Propagate by stratifying acorns in fall. Acorns will
germinate in spring. Some seeds may germinate near
existing plants.
Pests
No pests of major concern although the potential
list is long. It is usually pest-free.
Galls cause homeowners much concern. There are
many types and galls can be on the leaves or twigs.
Most galls are harmless so chemical controls are not
suggested.

Scales of several types can usually be controlled
with sprays of horticultural oil.
Aphids cause distorted growth and deposits of
honeydew on lower leaves. On large trees, naturallyoccurring predatory insects will often bring the aphid
population under control.
Boring insects are most likely to attack weakened
or stressed trees. Newly planted young trees may also
be attacked. Keep trees as healthy as possible with
regular fertilization and water during dry weather.
Many caterpillars feed on Oak. Large trees
tolerate some feeding injury without harm. Trees
repeatedly attacked, or having some other problem,
may need spraying. Tent caterpillars form nests in
trees then eat the foliage. The nests can be pruned out
when small. Where they occur, gypsy moth
caterpillars are extremely destructive on Oaks. Fall
cankerworm has been a problem in some years.
Twig pruner causes twigs to drop off in the
summer. The larvae ride the twig to the ground.
Rake up and destroy fallen twigs.
Lace bugs occasionally suck juices from leaves
causing them to look dusty or whitish gray.
Leaf miners cause brown areas in leaves. To
identify leaf miner injury tear the leaf in two across
the injury. If the injury is due to leaf miner, the upper
and lower leaf surfaces are separate and black insect
excrement will be seen.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern although the list
of potential problems is long. Usually this oak is
disease-free.
Anthracnose may be a serious problem in wet
weather. Infected leaves have dead areas following
the midrib or larger veins. These light brown blotches
may run together and, in severe cases, cause leaf drop.
Trees of low vigor, repeatedly defoliated, may die.
Trees defoliated several years in a row may need
spraying, to allow the tree to recover.
Canker diseases attack the trunk and branches.
Keep trees healthy by regular fertilization. Prune out
diseased or dead branches.
Leaf blister symptoms are round raised areas on
the upper leaf surfaces causing depressions of the same
shape and size on lower leaf surfaces. Infected areas
are yellowish-white to yellowish-brown. The disease
is most serious in wet seasons in the spring but it
usually does not need to be treated.
A large number of fungi cause leaf spots but are
usually not serious. Rake up and dispose of infected
leaves.
Powdery mildew coats leaves with white powdery
growth and is generally harmless.
Shoestring root rot attacks the roots and once
inside moves upward, killing the cambium. The leaves
on infected trees are small, pale or yellowed and fall
early. There is no practical control. Healthy trees
may be more resistant than trees of low vigor.
Chlorosis due to micronutrient-deficiency occurs
on high pH soil.
