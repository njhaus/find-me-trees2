INTRODUCTION
This deciduous native tree reaches 50 to 70 feet in
height with an equal spread, forming a broad, open,
rounded canopy and casting dense shade below (Fig.
1). The shiny, dark green, five to six-inch-long by
two to four-inch-wide leaves have fine white hairs on
their underside, and irregular margins. In fall, the
leaves turn a showy yellow/brown to red before
dropping. The oval, one-inch acorns are usually found
in pairs on one to four-inch-long stems, and are quite
attractive to a variety of mammals and birds. Swamp
White Oak has deeply ridged and furrowed, dark
brown bark, and forms an impressive shade tree.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Found in the wild along streams and in swampy
soils, Swamp White Oak should be grown in full sun
to partial shade on acid soils, showing severe chlorosis
on alkaline soils. These trees are very long-lived,
surviving for more than 300 years. They tolerate soil
compaction, drought and some salt exposure. They
should be tried more often in urban areas.
Transplanting is best done in springtime. Containergrown material can be planted anytime.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests
Borers, variable Oak caterpillar, Oak slug
caterpillar and other caterpillars are pests although
natural enemies usually keep infestations under
control. Gypsy moth can cause significant damage.
There are many other potential pests on Oak.
Diseases
Some diseases of this oak are anthracnose, canker,
powdery mildew, shoestring root rot and oak wilt.
Leaf spot diseases are usually harmless. Leaf blister
can cause moderate to severe defoliation. A dormant
spray may reduce symptoms.
