INTRODUCTION
Traveler’s-Tree is ideal for creating an exotic,
tropical effect with its very large, banana-like leaves,
each up to nine feet long and held in fan-shaped
formation, and the unusual, small, white flowers which
are held erect in canoe-shaped bracts (Fig. 1). Leaves
are usually seen tattered and torn from exposure to the
wind. Traveler’s-Tree will reach a height of 30 feet
and a spread of 18 feet, growing at a moderate rate. It
makes a nice tropical accent in a large landscape,
growing too large for most modest-sized yards. The
common name is derived from the fact that weary
travelers would quench their thirst on the rainwater
collected in the enlarged sheaths at the base of the
leaves.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Traveler’s-Tree will produce best growth in full
sun, though small potted plants may be grown in shade
for a period of time. Plants should be grown on fertile
soils, high in organic matter, and routinely cared for.
Plants should be grown only in frost-free locations.
Propagation is by division of basal suckers or by
seed, which are slow to germinate.
Pests
No pests are of major concern.
Diseases
Cercospora leaf-spot is a very serious disease
problem.
