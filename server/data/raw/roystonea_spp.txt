INTRODUCTION
Notably popular as street or specimen trees, Royal
Palms make a neat, tidy, yet stately landscape element
for large landscapes, often reaching 50 to 100 feet in
height in almost as many years (Fig. 1). The tall,
smooth, cement grey trunks are capped with a glossy,
green crown shaft several feet high and a beautiful,
broad, dense crown of soft, gently drooping, feathery
fronds. Flowers are incredibly fragrant, even from 50
feet away and are produced periodically throughout the
year but mostly in summer. The old fronds should be
removed before they drop since they can cause injury
or damage to plants or property when allowed to fall.
One frond will fall about every month.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Royal Palms grow quite rapidly when given an
abundance of water and fertilizer in full sun or dappled
shade. They withstand strong winds and salt spray
very well but some foliage injury will be evident on
Royal Palm located next to the ocean. It is not really
suited for beach side planting as Sabal Palm is. The
young developing fronds grow in a distorted, frizzled
manner in alkaline soil. This is usually attributed to
manganese or iron deficiency in the leaves. It can be
prevented with regular applications of a suitable
fertilizer or by planting in soil with a pH less than
about 7.5.
Roystonea elata is native to Florida and Roystonea
regia to Cuba. Cuban Royal Palm has less prominent
secondary leaf veins and nearly globose fruit. Many
nurseries do not distinguish between these two species
since they are very similar.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests
Some of Royal Palmâ€™s pests are palm leaf
skeletonizer, Royal Palm bug, giant palm weevil, and
scales when young. Any of these can be troublesome
in localized areas.
Diseases
Ganoderma butt rot is the most serious problem on
Royal Palms. It kills trees which it infects. The
disease often enters the trunk through injuries on the
lower trunk and roots.
