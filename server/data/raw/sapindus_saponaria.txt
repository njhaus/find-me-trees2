INTRODUCTION
Florida Soapberry grows at a moderate rate to 30
to 40 feet tall (Fig. 1). The pinnately compound,
evergreen leaves are 12 inches long with each leaflet
four inches long. Ten-inch-long panicles of small,
white flowers appear during fall, winter, and spring but
these are fairly inconspicuous. The fleshy fruits which
follow are less than an inch-long, shiny, and
orange/brown. The seeds inside are poisonous, a fact
which should be considered in the treeâ€™s placement in
the landscape, especially if children will be present.
The bark is rough and gray. The common name of
Soapberry comes from to the soap-like material which
is made from the berries in tropical countries.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Soapberry can be planted in low maintenance
landscapes for the unusually prominent, orange-colored
berries. They require little care other than some initial
pruning to direct growth and to develop a strong
branch structure. The bushy growth habit of this
medium-sized tree combines nicely with shrubs and
ground covers planted beneath and around the tree.
Fruits attract the boxelder bug.
Florida Soapberry should be grown in full sun and
will tolerate almost any soil. It is highly drought- and
salt-tolerant.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases of major concern.
