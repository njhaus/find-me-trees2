INTRODUCTION
Sequoia sempervirens, the Coast Redwoods of
California, are the tallest trees in the world (Fig. 1).
They can vary greatly when grown from seed, but
varieties are available now which have been
vegetatively propagated and they retain true
characteristics. Redwoods grow three to five feet per
year and are remarkably pest-free. They live to be
many hundreds of years old; some live to several
thousand years. Bark is particularly beautiful, turning
a bright orange on older trees. It may grow poorly in
zones 9 and 10 in Florida.

inconspicuous and not showy; no significant litter
problem
Trunk and Branches
Trunk/bark/branches: droop as the tree grows, and
will require pruning for vehicular or pedestrian
clearance beneath the canopy; should be grown with a
single leader; very showy trunk; no thorns
Pruning requirement: needs little pruning to develop
a strong structure
Breakage: resistant

Current year twig thickness: medium; thin
Wood specific gravity: 0.35
Culture
Light requirement: tree grows in part shade/part sun;
tree grows in full sun
Soil tolerances: clay; loam; sand; slightly alkaline;
acidic; occasionally wet; well-drained
Drought tolerance: moderate

Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: tree has winter interest due to
unusual form, nice persistent fruits, showy winter
trunk, or winter flowers
Outstanding tree: not particularly outstanding
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Ozone sensitivity: tolerant
Verticillium wilt susceptibility: not known to be
susceptible
Pest resistance: long-term health usually not
affected by pests
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Redwood maintains a pyramidal form and dark
green foliage throughout the year. Planted in a row 15
to 20 feet apart they make a nice screen. In areas
outside California and the Northwest, it is probably
best used occasionally as a novelty specimen.
Redwood is tolerant of flooding, making best
growth along stream banks and flood plains. Irrigation
helps maintain a vigorous tree in other sites. Allow
plenty of soil space for proper development.
Propagation is possible from seed and through
vegetative propagation.
Pests
Few insects were noted for Sequoia species.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern.
Sequoia sempervirens is resistant to oak root
fungus.
