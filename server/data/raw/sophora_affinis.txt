INTRODUCTION
Eveâ€™s Necklace, or Texas Sophora, is a native
North American, deciduous tree which grows
moderately fast to 35 feet tall and 20 feet wide (Fig.
1). Trees grown in the sun are often shorter. It has an
upright silhouette and pinnately compound leaves.
Branches often weep slightly lending a delicate texture
to the tree in the sun or shade. The fragrant, whitewith-pink blossoms appear in June in dense, two to
six-inch-long racemes, somewhat like wisteria. The
black seedpods which follow are up to four inches
long, the pod tightly pinched around each encased
seed, giving it almost the appearance of a string of
beads, hence its common name.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Texas Sophora often grows like a woody vine in
the wild. It can be used as an understory small tree in
a partially shaded location, but the crown will not be
as dense as when it is grown in full sun, and flowering
will be sparse. It makes a nice small tree for planting
next to the deck or patio where it casts light shade.
With some training and pruning to create a more
uniform growth habit, the tree would become more
popular.
Texas Sophora should be grown in full sun or
partial shade on any well-drained soil. Trees are
drought-tolerant and will flower most heavily if
located in full sun.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases of major concern.
