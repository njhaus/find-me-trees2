INTRODUCTION
An excellent, small to medium-sized, deciduous
garden tree, 30 to 40 feet tall and 25 to 30 feet wide,
Japanese Stewartia is an all-season performer,
exhibiting a distinctive branching pattern in winter,
camellia-like flowers in summer, and bright yellow
and red foliage in autumn (Fig. 1). Most other trees
have finished flowering by the time these flowers
emerge. Once you have seen it, the fall color is
unforgettable. The bark is spectacular, peeling off and
exposing contrasting colors. It could be grown for this
characteristic alone. The tree branches close to the
ground forming a sinewy pattern not unlike crape
myrtle. It would make a nice patio tree, could accent
an entry way, or could be grown as a canopy tree over
a sidewalk. A row of them on either side of a
sidewalk spaced 15 feet apart makes an outstanding
‘covered walkway’. It could be planted as a slowgrowing street tree beneath power lines due to its
small stature.

a strong structure
Breakage: resistant

tree grows in the shade; tree grows in full sun
Soil tolerances: clay; loam; sand; acidic;
occasionally wet; well-drained

Other
Roots: surface roots are usually not a problem
Winter interest: tree has winter interest due to
unusual form, nice persistent fruits, showy winter
trunk, or winter flowers
Outstanding tree: tree has outstanding ornamental
features and could be planted more
Invasive potential: little, if any, potential at this time
Pest resistance: no pests are normally seen on the
tree
USE AND MANAGEMENT
Japanese Stewartia is a slow-grower, reportedly
best in acid soil (pH 4.5 to 6.5) with ample moisture
and high organic matter content. But trees are also
found growing very well without irrigation in poorquality, compacted clay soil. Some leaf-burn may be
evident in drier summers in full sun but this does not
appear to impact the tree permanently. Stewartia may
prefer some shade in warm climates where it develops
a more open habit but does quite well in full-day sun
forming a dense, dark green head of foliage.
Transplant as a small tree from a field nursery in early
spring or from a container of any size at any time.
Propagation is by seeds or cuttings but is very
difficult.
Pests and Diseases
No pests or diseases of major concern.
