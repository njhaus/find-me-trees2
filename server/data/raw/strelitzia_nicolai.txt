INTRODUCTION
White Bird-of-Paradise is most often planted for
its large, banana-like leaves and upright, clumping
stalks which give an exotic feel to the landscape (Fig.
1). Plants can reach 20 to 30 feet in height with a
spread of 10 feet though they are often seen much
smaller. The five to eight-foot-long, cold-tender leaves
are arranged in a fanlike display from the erect trunks
and appear much like Travelerâ€™s-Tree. The lower
trunk becomes clear of leaves and exposed as the older
leaves drop off. Leaves rip along the veins as they are
blown by strong winds.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
The interesting flowers are white with a dark blue
tongue. White Bird-of-Paradise is ideal for
entranceways for a dramatic effect or for use at
poolside. Plants are not messy but ragged leaves
should be periodically removed for a tidy appearance.

accordingly.
White Bird-of-Paradise grows well in full sun to
light shade on moist, well-drained soil. Plants should
be protected from high winds to minimize torn, ragged
leaves. It will survive periods of 28-degrees F. with
minimal leaf burn and will quickly recover. Prune to
remove dead leaves and thin out surplus growth
sprouting from the base of the trunk, if you wish.
Propagation is by division of the suckers or from
seed which germinate slowly.
