INTRODUCTION
This large, semievergreen tree forms a loose,
rounded canopy and casts light, dappled shade,
suitable for maintaining a lawn beneath (Fig. 1). It is
one of south Floridaâ€™s popular landscape and street
trees. Mahogany can reach 75 feet in height with a
50-foot-spread but is more often seen at 40 to 50 feet
tall and wide. The dense, strong wood of Mahogany
is quite resistant to wind-damage on properly trained
trees, making this tree all the more ideal for use as a
shade tree or street tree. Trees planted along streets or
in medians will form a beautiful canopy overhead.
The five-inch-long, brown, woody fruit capsules hang
from slender, fuzzy stalks in winter and split while
still on the tree when ripe to release winged seeds.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
A native of south Florida, Mahogany will grow in
full sun or partial shade on a wide range of soil types,
and is quite resistant to salt spray. Plants will respond
with rapid growth to rich, well-drained soil and regular
fertilizing. Roots can raise sidewalks and curbs when
planted only five or six feet away. Root deflectors
and barriers which direct roots to a deeper soil layer
are recommended for this and other large-growing
trees with surface root problems. Be sure that trees
are planted and maintained with a central leader to
develop a strong trunk and branch structure. Trees
often develop several upright multiple leaders which
significantly reduces the wind and storm tolerance of
any tree, including Mahogany. Prune and train the
tree while it is young to develop several major limbs
spaced several feet apart along a central trunk. Do not
allow branches to grow larger than about two-thirds
the diameter of the trunk. This will increase the life
span of Mahogany.
This and several other species of Mahogany are
used in the lumber industry for fine cabinets and
furniture due to the color, straight grain and durability
of the wood. Swietenia macrophylla is a taller tree
with a dominant, straight trunk which could be grown
in Florida and used along the streets. There were
several trees three feet in diameter at the U.S.D.A.
research station south of Miami prior to hurricane
Andrew.
Propagation is by seed.
Pests
Some insects can cause significant problems such
as the tent caterpillars, tip moth, webworm, scale, leaf
notcher, and leaf miner. Borers infest stressed trees.
Diseases
No diseases are of major concern.
Nectria infections on branches are often
predisposed by some other stress or any injury to the
tree. These infections can be seen in the branch
crotches.
