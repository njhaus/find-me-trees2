INTRODUCTION
Pink Trumpet Tree produces a wonderful specimen
tree, reaching a height of 50 feet and is covered with
terminal panicles of pink to rose-purple, two-inchwide, showy blossoms in spring (Fig. 1). There are
few, if any, other flowering trees which can match the
beauty of this tree in bloom! Flowers stand out nicely
because there are no leaves on the tree during
flowering. They contrast nicely against the light grey
bark. The palmately compound leaves bear five
leaflets, each about two-and-one-half inches long.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Pink Trumpet Tree would make a nice tree for
planting along a boulevard or residential street where
there is plenty of soil space for root development.
Prune major limbs so they remain about one-half the
diameter of the trunk so they remain well secured to
the trunk. This is a tree you will want to keep around,
once you see it in flower.
Pink Trumpet Tree should be grown in full sun or
partial shade on rich, well-drained soil.
Propagation is by seed, cuttings, or layering.
Trees flower at an early age.
