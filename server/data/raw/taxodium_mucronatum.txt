INTRODUCTION
Montezuma Baldcypress, Mexicoâ€™s national tree, is
a huge tree in its native habitat and is pyramidal when
young with a dense crown but, like Baldcypress,
eventually develops into a broad-topped, spreading,
open specimen when mature with pendulous branches
(Fig. 1). Capable of reaching 100 to 150 feet in
height, most landscape specimens will reach this
height. The pale green, needle-like leaves are only
deciduous in the colder sections of its range, remaining
evergreen elsewhere. The trunk grows unusually thick
toward the base, even on young trees. One of the
most vivid examples of this trait is the Tule Cypress
found growing in Oaxaca, Mexico, which sports a
trunk diameter of 35 to 40 feet, or a circumference of
115 feet, while the tree itself is only 140 feet tall.
This tree has been estimated to be between 2,000 and
5,000 years old.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
It provides a good vertical accent to the landscape
and could be tried in urban areas. The roots probably
will not lift sidewalks and curbs as readily as some
other species since Baldcypress does not. Its delicate,
feathery foliage affords light, dappled shade, and the
heartwood of Montezuma Baldcypress is quite strong
and resistant to rot.
Although not truly a swamp tree as other
Taxodiums, Montezuma Baldcypress still grows well
in moist soil. Its seeds will only germinate in either
water or wet soil. Montezuma Baldcypress is
relatively maintenance-free, requiring pruning only to
remove dead wood and unwanted lower branches
which persist on the tree. It maintains a desirably
straight trunk and does not form double or multiple
leaders as do many other large trees. In the only test
that I am aware of in the East, growth was stunted in
Auburn University test plots where no irrigation was
provided. Since extensive testing of this tree is
lacking in the east, plant only a few of them to
evaluate adaptability in your area.
Propagation is by seed.
Diseases
Probably no diseases are serious.
