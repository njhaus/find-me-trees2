TERMINALIA MUELLERI: MUELLERS TERMINALIA1
Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson 2
INTRODUCTION
This is a small, 30-foot-tall, deciduous tree which forms a symmetrical, horizontally-layered silhouette from an arrow-straight trunk. The leathery, four-inch-long leaves turn attractively red in autumn and winter before dropping. In spring, the trees are decorated with spikes of tiny greenish-white blossoms which are followed by dark blue, small fruits. This tree is probably well suited for a street tree and other urban planting sites where a small tree is needed. It would also make a nice addition to the small residential lot as a specimen tree or small shade tree for a patio or deck.
