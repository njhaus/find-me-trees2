INTRODUCTION
This upright, pyramidal, evergreen tree has finetextured, drooping branches armed with sharp-pointed,
needle-like, glossy, dark green leaves (Fig. 1). The
leaves give off a strong odor of turpentine (or tomato
plant) when crushed. Florida Torreya can reach a
height of 40 feet with a 20-foot spread and has a slow
growth rate. It is native to the wooded slopes and
ravines along the eastern bank of the Appalachicola
River in western Florida and is extremely rare in the
wild. More widespread use of this native tree will
help save it from extinction.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Florida Torreya prefers partial shade and welldrained, slightly acid, fertile soil. Plants should be
watered faithfully and fertilized once in winter.
Encourage use of this plant by placing it in a
prominent location in a park, golf course, or other
public area.
Propagation is by cuttings. Mature wood cuttings
taken in winter root well. Seeds, when available,
germinate slowly and sporadically.
Pests
Scales can be found infesting the twigs and
foliage.
Diseases
Mushroom root rot and blight will infect some
landscape plantings.
