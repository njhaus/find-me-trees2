Leyland Cypress1
Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2
INTRODUCTION
A rapidly-growing evergreen when young, Leyland
Cypress will easily grow three to four feet per year,
even on poor soils, and will ultimately attain a
majestic height of 50 feet or more in the west, perhaps
somewhat shorter in the east (Fig. 1). Leyland
Cypress forms a dense, oval or pyramidal outline when
left unpruned, but the graceful, slightly pendulous
branches will tolerate severe trimming to create a
formal hedge, screen or windbreak. The fine, feathery
foliage is composed of soft, pointed leaves on flattened
branchlets and are dark blue-green when mature, soft
green when young. Leyland Cypress quickly outgrows
its space in small landscapes and is too big for most
residential landscapes unless it will be regularly
trimmed. Although it can be sheared into a tall screen
on small lots, Leyland Cypress should probably be
saved for large-scale landscapes where it can be
allowed to develop into its natural shape.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
Leyland Cypress grows in full sun on a wide
range of soils, from acid to alkaline, but looks its best
on moderately fertile soil with sufficient moisture. It
is surprisingly tolerant of severe pruning, recovering
nicely from even severe topping (although this is not
recommended), even when half the top is removed. It
grows well in clay soil and tolerates poor drainage for
a short period of time. It also is very tolerant of salt
spray.
Some available cultivars include: ‘Castlewellan’, a
more compact form with gold-tipped leaves, excellent
for hedges in cool climates; ‘Leighton Green’, dense
branching with dark green foliage, columnar form;
‘Haggerston Gray’, loose branches, columnarpyramidal, upturned at ends, sage-green color;
‘Naylor’s Blue’, blue-grey foliage, columnar form;
‘Silver Dust’, wide-spreading form with blue-green
foliage marked with white variegations.
Propagation is by cuttings from side growths.
Pests
Bagworm can defoliate a tree in a week or two,
and can be quite serious.
Diseases
A canker affects the tree following drought; a
foliage fungus occasionally infects foliage. This plant
is not recommended for planting in California due to
the severity of this canker disease. Perhaps the disease
will stay in the western United States.
