White Fir1
Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G. Watson2
INTRODUCTION
One of the best firs for the east, White Fir reaches
a mature height of 75 feet or more but is often much
smaller in the landscape, 40 to 50 feet (Fig. 1). It has
a pyramidal shape and horizontal branching with the
lower branches drooping toward the ground. The tree
should be grown in an open area so the lower branches
can touch the ground. When branched to the ground,
White Fir will cast dense shade which kills turf grass.
The foliage is a wonderful blue-gray which appears
much like that of the Colorado blue spruce. White Fir
may grow one and a half feet per year with good
growing conditions. This tree can take exposure and
will withstand some heat and drought better than most
firs. Abies firma is much more heat-tolerant, has green
glossy foliage, and grows even further south into
USDA hardiness zone 8.

USE AND MANAGEMENT
White Fir transplants well-balled and burlapped, if
properly root pruned; otherwise it will be hard to
transplant. The tree prefers a moist, well-drained loam
and dislikes heavy clay or high pH soils. The root
system can adapt to wet or rocky soil conditions by
growing close to the surface of the soil. It will not
tolerate clay or constantly wet soil. As a Christmas
tree, White Fir remains fresh and retains its needles for
two weeks or more if provided with water. White Fir
is an excellent substitute for the disease-sensitive
Colorado blue spruce, since it is less prone to diseases.
Unfortunately, White Fir is rare in the horticultural
trade, but it should be grown and used more often.
Cultivars include ‘Conica’ which is more dwarf and
conically-shaped, and ‘Violacea’ which has beautiful
silver-gray foliage.
Pests
Generally none are serious, but a few cause some
damage. The balsam twig aphid feeds on the new
growth of fir causing distorted needles and deposits of
honeydew. Trees can tolerate fairly heavy infestations
for a short period of time but are weakened by
repeated heavy infestations.
Bagworm builds and lives in a two to three-inch
long sack built from needles and other debris. The
insect overwinters as eggs in the sacks of the female.
Control by hand-picking the bags in winter.
The more common scale insects infesting fir are
oystershell, pine needle, and cottony cushion. These
insects are hard to control once inside their shell or
waxy coatings. The crawler stage is most easily
controlled with appropriate pesticides.
Spider mites in hot areas cause older needles to
lose green coloration and become yellowed. The
insects are very small and difficult to see so
infestations can become severe before being noticed.
This is perhaps the most common problem.
Diseases
Generally none are serious enough to cause
concern. Needle and twig blight results in the
shriveling and reddening of the new growth. The
needles of current seasons growth are curled and dead.
Terminal growth and some laterals may be killed.
Pine twig blight is a problem on stressed trees.
The fungus will not ordinarily be a problem unless the
host plant is weakened. The infection usually begins
at the terminal bud near a branch tip. Infection takes
place in late summer and the disease progresses down
a twig into a node. At times the infection may go into
2-year-old wood. Needles on infected branches turn
reddish then die. Cut off and destroy infected twigs.
Several rusts attack firs but are not a problem on
landscape trees. The diseases are rarely seen.
Several different fungi cause cankers on the trunks
and branches of firs. Cankers are sunken areas in the
bark that gradually get larger. When the stem is
completely encircled the part beyond the canker dies.
Keep the plants healthy by fertilizing and watering
during dry weather. Cankers can be largely prevented
by avoiding plant injury.

Root rots caused by several fungi kill roots and rot
wood. Little can be done to control the diseases other
than to keep trees healthy to prevent disease infection.
Maintain tree health by regular fertilization and
watering during dry weather.
